Reverence

1929_a.txt

A  third  principle  that  contributes  to  right  religious  attitude  is reverence — reverence  for  the  Sabbath  day  and  all  things  sacred.  Reverence directs  thought  toward  God.  Without  it  there  is  no  religion.  Let us  not  make  Sunday  a  holiday.  It  is  a  holy  day,  and  on  that  day we  should  go  to  the  house  of  worship  and  seek  our  God.  If  we  seek him  on  the  Sabbath  day,  get  into  his  presence  on  that  day,  we  shall  find it  less  difficult  to  be  in  his  presence  the  following  days  of  the  week. There  should  be  more  reverence  for  the  house  of  worship.  I  am offended  when  I  see  in  Sunday  School,  or  perhaps  in  Mutual,  members leave  the  service  after  having  rendered  a  musical  number.  Undoubtedly, they  go  to  some  other  place  to  render  the  same  service.  Even  that  is not  sufficient  justification  for  the  mark  of  seeming  irreverence  in  leaving a  worshiping  assembly.  Better  secure  somebody  who  can  stay  throughout the  service,  for  the  assembly  in  a  dedicated  chapel  is  in  the  presence of  God.  All  are  supposed  to  have  come  to  meet  him  and  worship  him, and  there  should  be  present  that  spirit  of  order  and  reverence  which will  direct  the  worshipers'  thoughts  in  the  right  channel. 

>>> This paragraph describes the practice of attending the house of worship on the Sabbath day. It emphasizes the importance of reverence and order during worship, which includes staying throughout the service and not leaving after performing a musical number. The act of leaving is seen as a mark of seeming irreverence. This suggests that the worship service is not meant to be entirely quiet, as it involves musical numbers and requires the active participation of the congregation.

To  sum  up  then,  the  operation  of  the  law  of  cause  and  effect  is as  constant  in  the  spiritual  realm  as  it  is  in  the  material  world.  You obey  the  principle  and  you  receive  the  blessing,  and  the  keeping  of each  promise  made  in  relation  to  the  sacrament  brings  the  results  and the  blessings  as  sure  as  the  sun  brings  light.  Order,  reverence,  attention to  divine  promises, — the  promise  to  enter  into  the  fold  of  Christ,  to cherish  virtues  mentioned  in  the  gospel  of  Christ,  to  keep  them  ever in  mind,  to  love  the  Lord  whole-heartedly,  and  to  labor,  even  at  the sacrifice  of  self,  for  the  brotherhood  of  man — these  and  all  kindred virtues  are  associated  with  the  partaking  of  the  Lord's  supper.  It  is good  to  meet  together  and  especially  to  renew  our  covenants  with  God in  that  holy  eucharist.  "Help  us  O,  God,  to  realize  the  great  atoning sacrifice,  the  gift  of  thy  beloved  Son,  the  Prince  of  peace,  the  Holy  One." 

>>> This paragraph discusses the sacrament, a key worship practice in the Latter-day Saint tradition. The sacrament involves partaking of bread and water in remembrance of Jesus Christ, which is often accompanied by hymns and prayers. The paragraph mentions the importance of order, reverence, and attention to divine promises during this practice. This implies that the sacrament is a communal and participatory act, not a silent one.

As  a  Church  in  our  worshiping  assemblies,  we  have  much  room  for improvement  in  this  regard.  Stake  officers,  Bishops,  Quorum  Presidents, Auxiliary  leaders  should  make  a  special  effort  to  maintain  more  reverence during  hours  of  worship.  Children  should  be  impressed  with  the  inappropriateness  of  confusion  and  disorder  in  a  worshiping  assembly,  and should  be  made  to  realize  that  it  is  the  height  of  rudeness  to  leave  service before  dismissal.  Young  people  who  ignore  such  proprieties  are  two hundred  and  fifty  years  behind  the  times.  They  should  have  lived  in colonial  days  when  just  to  make  sure  that  they  stayed  out  the  service, young  men  were  locked  in  their  pews  by  their  superiors.

Fourth,  to  worship  the  Lord  in  sincerity  and  reverence,  and  to give  and  to  receive  encouragement,  exhortation,  and  instruction. 

>>> This paragraph outlines the purposes of gathering for worship, which include transacting current Church business, hearing reports and general Church statistics, approving or disapproving of certain names, and worshiping the Lord in sincerity and reverence.

Brethren, we recommend that we surround this sacred ordinance with more reverence, with perfect order, that each one who comes to the house of God may meditate upon his goodness and silently and prayerfully express appreciation for God's goodness. Let the sacrament hour be one experience of the day in which the worshiper tries at least to realize within himself that it is possible for him to commune with his God.

I have, really, on my mind but one message. I am going to say one appeal for this vast audience of leaders. I believe there is one great need in the Church which you presidencies of stakes, bishoprics of wards, presidencies of quorums, and officers in auxiliaries, can supply. I have in mind the need of more reverence in our houses of worship, better order and discipline in our classrooms, in quorum meetings and in auxiliary groups.

>>> This paragraph mentions the need for more reverence in houses of worship, better order, and discipline in classrooms, quorum meetings, and auxiliary groups. The mention of discipline and order suggests that these gatherings involve active participation and are not meant to be entirely quiet.

Reverence should be particularly manifest in sacrament meeting in quorum meetings, in Sunday School, in M.I.A., in Primary, yes and in Relief Society. This is a missionary Church. People come here for light and knowledge, for instruction, and they have a right to find it when they come. 

>>> This paragraph emphasizes the importance of reverence in various meetings such as sacrament meetings, quorum meetings, Sunday School, M.I.A., Primary, and Relief Society. It mentions that people come to these meetings for light, knowledge, and instruction, implying that these meetings involve teaching and learning, which are not silent activities.

Six months from that time when we held a meeting with the elders in that district, prior to the opening of the conference, we said: "Brethren, the Lord is not displeased with our greetings, expressions of love and brotherhood, but he is displeased with the irreverent attitude, and we have some choice people, strangers who are not used to this free intercourse of greetings so characteristic of Latter-day Saint meetings. So tomorrow morning, after you have greeted your friends from various places, without any announcement, at seven minutes to ten o'clock, you quietly take your seats. Do not say a word. You just go to your assigned places." 


>>> This paragraph describes a meeting with elders where they were instructed to greet their friends and then quietly take their seats without saying a word. The mention of greetings indicates that there is a level of interaction and communication in these meetings, which goes beyond quiet contemplation.

In our meeting houses today we have reverence just as soon as the hour comes for worship, but in Sunday Schools particularly, at the change of classes there is a hub-bub. That is not educative to our children. They have done away with the marching we used to have when I was in the Sunday School work in Weber. They now think it undignified for older persons to march.

A most commendable project for 1951-52 stressed four phases of reverence for boys and girls. I will read those: 1. We will act as we should in our Heavenly Father's house. 2. We will greet our friends quietly. 3. We will not take the name of the Lord in vain. 4. We will respect those chosen by our Heavenly Father to lead us.

>>> This paragraph lists four phases of reverence for boys and girls, one of which is “We will greet our friends quietly.” The mention of greeting friends indicates that there is some level of interaction and communication, which implies that these gatherings are not entirely silent.

Three influences in home life awaken reverence in children and contribute to its development in their souls.  These are: first, firm but Gentle Guidance; second, Courtesy shown by parents to each other, and to children; and third, Prayer in which children participate.  In every home in this Church parents should strive to act intelligently in impressing children with those three fundamentals. 

>>> This paragraph mentions three influences in home life that awaken reverence in children and contribute to its development in their souls. One of these influences is “Prayer in which children participate.” The participation of children in prayer suggests that there is some level of interaction and communication, which implies that these gatherings are not entirely silent.

In this regard, as members of the Church in our worshiping assemblies, we have much room for improvement. Presiding authorities in stake, ward, and quorum meetings, and especially teachers in classes, should make special effort to maintain better order and more reverence during hours of worship and of study. Less talking behind the pulpit will have a salutary effect upon those who face it. By example and precept, children should be impressed with the inappropriateness of confusion and disorder in a worshiping congregation.  They should be impressed in childhood, and have it emphasized in youth, that it is disrespectful to talk or even to whisper during a sermon, and that it is the height of rudeness, excepting in an emergency, to leave a worshiping assembly before dismissal.

I commend Bishop Wirthlin and Bishop Richards for their excellent messages to us on reverence, and as one of them said at the base of it all is this virtue of self-control, self-mastery. There is no whispering by parents during the administration of the Sacrament when they exercise this virtue. There is no whispering after entering the House of God. There is communion between the spirit, and the Spirit of the Lord. There is no whispering on the rostrum, because all preparation is made beforehand. 

>>> This paragraph commends Bishop Wirthlin and Bishop Richards for their excellent messages on reverence and mentions that there is no whispering by parents during the administration of the Sacrament when they exercise the virtue of self-control. The mention of no whispering suggests that there is usually some level of quiet speaking involved in these worship practices.

>>> (About the previous 4 paragraphs): These paragraphs suggest that while reverence and respect are highly valued in Latter-day Saint worship practices, there are aspects of these practices that involve interaction, communication, and participation, which are not entirely silent. These elements likely serve to foster a sense of community and shared worship among the participants.

I strongly urge that this sacred ordinance be surrounded with more reverence, with perfect order; that each one who comes to the house of God may meditate upon and silently and prayerfully express appreciation for God's goodness. It is up to you bishops to see to it that the sacrament is administered only by boys and young men who are worthy to attend to this sacred ordinance, and that it is done reverently with a full understanding of its significance to them and to the audience. Let the sacrament hour be one experience of the day in which the worshiper tries at least to realize within himself that it is possible for him to commune with his God. 

>>> This paragraph describes the sacrament, a sacred ordinance in Latter-day Saint worship. The sacrament is a time for individual meditation and silent, prayerful expressions of appreciation for God’s goodness. However, it also involves the active participation of worthy boys and young men who administer the sacrament. This administration is not a quiet act, as it involves movement and the distribution of the sacrament to the congregation.

Whether the place of meeting is a humble chapel, or a "poem in architecture" built of white marble and inlaid with precious stones, makes little or no difference in our approach and attitude toward the Infinite Presence. To know that God is there should be sufficient to impel us to conduct ourselves orderly, reverently. Presiding authorities in stake, ward, and quorum meetings, and especially teachers in classes, should make a special effort to maintain better order and more reverence during the hours of worship and study. Less talking behind the pulpit will have a salutary effect upon those who face it. By example and precept, children should be impressed with the inappropriateness of confusion and disorder in a worshiping congregation. They should be impressed in childhood, and have it emphasized in youth, that it is disrespectful to talk or even to whisper during a sermon, and that it is the height of rudeness, except in an emergency, to leave a worshiping assembly before dismissal. 

>>> This paragraph emphasizes the need for order and reverence during worship and study hours, which includes active participation from presiding authorities in stake, ward, and quorum meetings, as well as teachers in classes. It also mentions the inappropriateness of talking or whispering during a sermon, suggesting that sermons are a part of the worship practice where active listening is expected.

>>> (about the previous two paragraphs): These paragraphs suggest that while reverence and respect are crucial in Latter-day Saint worship practices, they are not always quiet. Active participation, whether through administering the sacrament or actively listening and responding during sermons and teachings, is an integral part of the worship experience. These activities, while respectful, are not silent or passive. They involve engagement and interaction, reflecting the communal and participatory nature of Latter-day Saint worship practices.

Worship Paragraphs

"I  many  times  say,  the  writers  of newspapers,  pamphlets,  poems,  books, these  are  the  real,  working,  effective church  of  modern  times.  Nay,  not  only our  preaching,  but  even  our  worship, is  not  it,  too,  accomplished  by  means  of printed  books?  The  noble  sentiment which  a  gifted  soul  has  clothed  for  us in  melodious  words,  which  brings  melody into  our  hearts — is  not  this  essentially, if  we  will  undrestand  it,  of  the nature  of  worship?  There  are  many,  in all  countries,  who,  in  this  confused  time, have  no  other  method  of  worship.  He who  in  any  way  shows  us  better  than we  knew  before  that  a  lily  of  the  field is  beautiful,  does  he  not  show  it  us  as an  effluence  of  the  fountain  of  all  beauty ;  as  the  handwriting  made  visible there  of  the  great  Maker  of  the  Universe? He  has  sung  for  us,  made  us sing  with  him,  a  little  verse  of  a  sacred psalm.  Essentially  so,  how  much more he  who  sings,  who  says  or  in  any  way brings  home  to  our  hearts  the  noble  doings, feelings,  darings  and  endurance  of a  brother  man !  He  has  verily  touched our  heart  as  with  a  live  coal  from  the altar.  Perhaps  there  is  no  worship  more authentic." 

>>> This paragraph describes the active role of various forms of media (newspapers, pamphlets, poems, books) in modern church practices. It suggests that worship is not just a quiet, personal experience, but also involves active engagement with these materials. The act of reading, interpreting, and applying the teachings from these sources requires active mental engagement and can involve discussion and sharing of insights, which are not quiet activities.

They  went  forth  preaching  the Gospel  of  salvation,  comparing  its principles  and  truths  with  the  principles taught  by  men,  emphasizing the  doctrines  of  the  Church,  but leaving  men  to  judge  for  themselves whether  the  message  they gave  was  true  and  therefore  for the  good  of  humanity,  or  whether it  was  evil.  Through  the  inspiration of  God,  thousands  recognized the  saving  principles  taught  by those  humble  Elders.  Hundreds gathered,  soon  thousands,  and  they began  to  build  up  the  Church.  Follow them  from  Kirtland.  through the  state  of  Missouri.  Read  the early  history  of  the  Church,  as  we were  admonished  this  moraine,  and see  how  the  barren  places  of  the west — for  it  was  western  country then — were  made  fruitful ;  how cities  sprang  up  where  there  had been  nothing  but  desolation.  Follow them  from  those  homes,  as they  were  driven  by  the  bayonet. See  them  camping  in  a  marsh  in Illinois,  and  there,  in  a  miraculously short  time,  build  the  city  of Nauvoo,  the  pride  of  the  west. Builders  ?  Yes — benefactors  to humanity.  Aside  from  their  doctrines— the  doctrines  of  Christ,  absolutely proved  from  the  Scriptures— take  the  people  as  citizens, as  men  mingling with  fellow  men, and  you  find  them  benefactors  in every  sense  of  the  word.  But  notwithstanding their  good  works,  not many  years  passed  before  they were  again  without  homes — their farms  unattended,  the  grain  going back  to  the  ground  because  there were  no  harvesters ;  the  walks  leading to  their  houses  becoming  grassgrown,  because  no  feet  were  there to  tread  them ;  the  hearth  cold,  because no  hands  were  there  to  light the  fire.  Where  were  they?  Again in  the  wilderness  of  the  west;  one thousands  miles  ahead  of  them nothing  but  buffalo.  Indians,  barrenness, sterility.  When  I  recently visited  Omaha,  being  a  few  miles from  Florence,  I  was  forcibly  reminded of  the  early  experiences  of our  parents  at  that  place,  and  at Des  Moines,  Iowa,  then  on  the frontier.  I  have  heard  them  tell how  they  prepared  their  teams, hitching  up  a  cow  with  an  ox, sometimes  a  cow  with  a  horse, making  ready  to  take  that  thousand mile  journey;  where?  Out  into the  barrenness,  out  into  the wilderness,  and  yet  still  into  the country,  under  the  flag  of  the Union.  What  was  their  purpose? What  was  the  motive?  As  a  prominent educator  in  Chicago  said, the  other  day :  "Not,  for  the  golden California,  but  that  they  might worship  God  Almighty  according to  t1ne  dictates  of  their  conscience ; and  I  admire  them  for  it."  Such was  their  motive — to  build  the Church  and  to  save  the  principles revealed  to  man.  They  had  risked all ;  they  had  risked  life  and everything  they  had,  and  were  willing to  endure  any  hardship — wives  walked  every  step  of  the  way on  this  long  journey;  mothers  carrying their  babes.  On  the  24th  of July,  1847,  they  were  here  in  this valley.  What  did  they  see?  You try  to  picture  what  they  saw.  These words  will  call  up  the  barren picture  in  the  minds  of  pioneers who  are  with  us  today — God  bless them  and  preserve  them  long  with us  for  what  they  have  done,  that we  might  at  least  express  our  appreciation of  their  devotion  to  the truth.  They  saw  sagebrush ;  they heard  the  howl  of  the  coyote ;  they saw  in  the  distance  the  smoke  of the  Indian  fire ;  and  the  salt  sea  in the  west  reflecting  the  beautiful sunlight;  but  there  was  no  apparent place  for  a  home.  There  was nothing  here  inviting;  in  fact,  they had  been  warned  that  nothing would  grow;  a  thousand  dollars had  been  offered  for  the  first  ear of  corn  that  they  would  .produce. Yet,  within  a  few  feet  of  where  we meet  today,  the  Prophet  of  the Lord  said,  "Here  we  shall  build  a house  to  God."  Now  what  do  we see?  Just  look  at  our  citv  today; its  climate  modified;  its  fruit  unexcelled; substantial  and  comfortable homes  everywhere;  towns  and cities  flourishing.  To  whom  are we  indebted  for  all  this?  The  people of  the  Mormon  Church,  the pioneers  of  1847,  and  subsequent years.  They  were  builders,  colonizers, benefactors  to  our  nation, benefactors  to  humanity.  Did  they tear  down  anything?  Did  they destroy?  Did  they  find  fault?  No. They  (protected  themselves,  with a  motive  that  they  might  continue to  bless.

In  Germany  the  work  is  growing  by  leaps  and  bounds.  You  will be  interested  to  know  that  last  March  in  Koenigsberg  when  we  'held our  conference,  there  were  sitting  on  the  stand  in  the  beautiful  gymnasium, part  of  a  public  school,  seventy-five  children  who  furnished music  for  the  six  hundred  people  assembled  in  a  Sunday  School session  of  conference.  That  night  seventy-five  adult  voices  furnished the  music  for  the  conference,  the  hall  crowded  to  capacity,  and  as part  of  that  service  they  rendered  most  efficiently  and  effectively  part of  Haydn's  "Creation."  On  that  same  tour,  on  the  following  Tuesday at  Stettin,  We  found  the  hall  crowded  to  capacity  at  ten  minutes to  7:00  o'clock.  An  excellent  choir  furnished  the  music.  On  our  way to  that  service,  publicly  announced,  we  passed  on  our  left  the  jail in  which  some  of  our  elders  had  been  incarcerated  but  a  few  years  before, for  preaching,  or  attempting  to  preach  the  gospel  of  Jesus  Christ. On  the  following  Sunday  in  one  of  the  large  assembly  rooms  of  a school  house  in  Berlin  there  were  assembled  over  one  thousand children,  Sunday  School  members,  in  one  of  the  most inspirational  Sunday  School  sessions  I  have  ever  attended.  It  is  a  significant fact  that  the  street  car  officials  of  that  great  city,  ran  special cars  for  the  benefit  of  the  Latter-day  Saint  children.  That  afternoon we  met  in  the  Staat  hall  in  Berlin,  twelve  hundred  eighty-six  people worshiping  God  there  without  molestation.  Five  minutes  walk  from where  we  met  stands  the  jail  in  which  President  Clawson,  my  brother Thomas  E.,  and  some  of  their  fellow-workers  were  incarcerated,  a  few years  ago,  for  attempting  to  hold  meetings  such  as  we  were  holding there  with  permission  of  the  Berlin  authorities.  On  October  7,  1924,  in Hamburg  we  held  a  most  remarkable  conference.  On  the  Saturday night  of  which  one  hundred  voices,  nearly  all  of  whom  were  members  of the  Church  rendered  Evan  Stephen's  "The  Vision"  in  a  most  inspirational manner.  Sunday  night,  as  the  concluding  number  of  an  inspirational, never-to-be-forgotten  conference,  that  same  'choir  sang "The  Martyrs."  These  two  great  productions  have  been  translated  into German  by  one  of  our  own  brethren.  The  choir  had  been  trained  by  one of  our  own  elders.

It  is  true  that  "religious  excitement"  led  Joseph  Smith  to  seek  the right  church,  the  proper  mode  of  worship,  the  right  way  to  live.  A  desire to  know  this  impelled  the  youth  to  seek  the  Lord  for  wisdom  in  the spring  of  1820,  the  greatest  result  of  the  answer  to  his  prayer  being  the organization  of  the  Church,  in  Peter  Wihitmer,  Sr's.  home,  on  Tuesday, April  6,  1830.

Not many days ago I had a deeply spiritual experience that gave me added proof of the power of the gospel to make men brothers spiritually By chance I read in one of the theater news sheets the reports of a Christmas program conducted by Protestant and Catholic German P.O.W. chaplains stationed at the 99th Field Hospital near Pisa. The news item stated that the special music was presented by the P.O.W. orchestra and a "Mormon" vocal soloist. The following day I went in search of this "Mormon" P.O.W., and with the help of an American chaplain I found him, a former Dresden District missionary, who served for a year and a half under President Rees in the East German Mission—Elder Hans Karl Schade, 25 Sebnitzer Street, Dresden, Germany. A few days previous to our meeting, the theater chaplain, Colonel Frank Brown, had met Elder Schade at a worship service and when he found Elder Schade was a Latter-day Saint, he gave him my name. And so when I first saw Elder Schade in the eye clinic where he now works, he extended his right hand and said, as he walked towards me, "Brother Braithwaite, thank God for this meeting." I shall never forget that expression—nor Elder Schade. In the presence of another chaplain and my interpreter, we spoke with complete freedom and with an understanding that destroys distrust, vengeance, or hate. We met on common ground, and thanked God for our fellowship in the Gospel. It was the time when I asked him to sing for me and our men, and to attend our L.D.S. services in Leghorn, that he reminded me he was a prisoner of war. However, even the restrictions involved caused no seeming barriers in our relationship. An understanding commanding officer gave permission for him to sing for us, and for us to go to his office to visit him.

One of the main weapons, I think, not mentioned very often, one that creeps upon us very quietly, is the love of money. The love of money, we are told, is at the root of all evil 1 Tim. 6:10 You may not agree with me, some of you, in what I am going to say now, but I believe that one of the main reasons why it is so difficult for some of our members to pay tithing is because Satan does not want us to pay tithing. He puts all kinds of excuses in our way, because he knows that a person or a people who will pay tithing will never worship gold instead of God. We are so bent, I was going to say hell-bent, on getting rich, making money, that we miss some of the sweetest things in life, brethren and sisters. We never have time to look up at the beautiful blue sky or enjoy our wonderful sunsets or see the beautiful flowers and the bluebird hopping from post to post or hear the song of the meadowlark as we speed along the highways. We have no time to go into these colorful canyons with our families and occasionally take a fishing trip, something unpardonable. No, we are too busy for these things. Yes, the love of money, the use of tobacco, liquor—Brother Merrill referred to in his splendid address —yesterday are weapons of Satan that he is using to thwart the purposes of God. 

>>> This paragraph discusses the practice of tithing, which involves the active participation of members in donating a portion of their income to the church. This is not a quiet practice as it requires action and engagement from the members.

The first is, attend to the immediate duty in hand. No person living in this Church can say he or she has not an immediate duty. It may be attendance at a priesthood meeting; the Aaronic Priesthood or Melchizedek. It may be fasting on the first Sunday and giving fast offerings for the poor. Do not say those are insignificant duties; it may be the duty of attending worship on the Sabbath day, either in Sunday School, Priesthood meeting or Sacrament meeting or Mutual at night; it may be visiting a sick neighbor; or it is the payment of tithing. Whatever the immediate duty, perform it. That is the first step. 

>>> This paragraph mentions several duties that require active participation, such as attending priesthood meetings, fasting on the first Sunday and giving fast offerings for the poor, attending worship on the Sabbath day in various meetings, and visiting a sick neighbor.

Again, every Sunday in Sacrament meeting we give our word of honor, that we are willing to take upon us the name of the Son, that we will always remember him, that we will keep his commandments which he has given us, that we may have his Spirit to be with us  D&C 20:77 What a covenant! And we make it in the presence of one another and in the presence of God whom we are worshipping that day.

As I contemplate the vast audience of Priesthood tonight, assembled in the various places named at the opening of the meeting, and realize the potency and power of this great body of men, I am overwhelmed.  As I sat in the audience and listened to the message given so impressively by the Bishopric, and so successfully by the men and women who produced that film, I felt my feelings swell within my breast as to the possibility of the good that will be done, and can be done, by these fifteen or twenty or twenty-five thousand men of the Priesthood who are worshipping tonight. 

>>> This paragraph mentions a gathering of the Priesthood, where messages are given and received. The act of delivering and listening to these messages involves active engagement and is not a quiet practice.

Gratefully we mention again the assistance rendered by the various radio and television stations here in our own city and state and in other states named in the various sessions of this conference.  What a means of permitting hundreds of thousands of people to hear the proceedings of this conference of the Church!  We thank you congregations assembled in the stakes in California, Arizona, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, and Colorado for the messages of appreciation you have sent in.  Everyone has said that the proceedings have gone over the wire perfectly and then added: "Thank you and God bless you for the opportunity we have had this day of joining and worshiping with you."

That is just preliminary. I said I saw these two boys leave the building this afternoon, and it reminded me that in some of our wards, these young men who have been appointed to administer the sacrament, and who have officiated in the order of the Priesthood, start for the door and leave the worshiping assembly. I will not say it is sacrilege, but I will say that it is not in keeping with the order and sacredness of the service which they have rendered by virtue of the Priesthood.

May I say to these students that their presence and especially their inspiring singing add much to the sacredness of this assembly.  It is glorious to have several hundred students sing with such spirit and devotion.  We are proud of them and of the university from which they come. We appreciate the cooperation of President Wilkinson, members of the faculty, and the students in postponing their regular day's work in school to join in this worship.

He said, "I listened to what these men said." One of them had referred to the pioneers and the spirit of the pioneers; that before they started out across the plains under the direction of President Young, they sought divine guidance first. Second, under his direction, they were prepared. Every man would carry a gun and must be prepared for an attack of savages or any other possible emergency that might come to the pioneers that day. And third, every man must take just as much care of his neighbor's cattle as he did of his own. Worship, Preparation, Service!

Those who are active are working in an organized way for the betterment of one another, for the personal welfare of the membership and for the good of society as a whole. If we considered no further than the quorums, is not that a sublime picture, where men and boys may congregate, associate, affiliate in service for humanity, in which every man considers everyone a brother? In that quorum the doctor sits by the side of a carpenter, each interested in the most ennobling of aspirations—worship of God and helpful service to humanity! There is the essence of priesthood work in the Church, and, in the achievement of the purpose, every act and influence should be performed or wielded only "by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned." The words of the Prophet!  D&C 121:41

Homes are more permanent through love. Oh, then, let love abound! Though you fall short in some material matters, study and work and pray to hold your children's love. Establish and maintain your family hours always. Stay close to your children. Pray, play, work, and worship together. This is the counsel of the Church. Would you have a strong and virile nation?—then keep your homes pure. Would you reduce delinquency and crime?—then lessen the number of broken homes. It is time that civilized peoples realized that the home largely determines whether children shall be of high or low character. Home-building, therefore, should be the paramount purpose of parents and of the nation. 

>>> The paragraph that describes Latter-day Saint worship practices that are not supposed to be quiet is:

>>> Paragraph 6: This paragraph emphasizes the importance of active family worship practices. It encourages families to pray, play, work, and worship together.

The counsel of the Church to “pray, play, work, and worship together” implies a form of worship that is not exclusively quiet but involves various forms of interaction and communal participation.

>>> The rest of the paragraphs primarily focus on personal meditation, introspection, and spiritual communion, which are typically quiet and introspective practices. They emphasize the importance of personal purity, resisting temptation, and the sacredness of houses of worship. These practices are generally associated with quiet reflection and introspection.



PRAISE

Saturday  night  the  choir  of  one  hundred  voices  was  assisted  by one  hundred  fifty  children  who  sang  "Praise  to  the  man  who  communed with  Jehovah."  A  man  not  in  the  Church  was  sitting  by  my  side,  and when  those  combined  choirs  sang  so  inspiringly  and  in  perfect  tune, so  far  as  my  ear  could  detect,  I  dropped  my  head  because  of  the  tears in  my  eyes,  and  I  saw  tears  rolling  down  my  companion's  cheeks,  impressed beyond  expression.  These  are  but  a  few  incidents  indicative of  the  progress  now  being  made  in  the  European  mission.  Another encouraging  indication  is  the  fact  that  leading  papers  in  London  and in  Liverpool  and  other  great  cities  of  the  European  mission  have  refused to  print  slanderous  stories  about  the  so-called  "Mormons."  A few  years  ago  these  vile  slanders  were  given  free  currency.  I  will  add also  that  the  Latter-day  Saints  in  those  missions  are  united  with  the elders  in  counteracting  the  falsehoods  and  vilifications  and  vituperations that  are  so  generally  accepted  as  true.  Tracting  societies,  carried on  by  our  own  members,  are  quietly,  though  effectively,  overcoming the  ignorance  that  seems  to  be  the  cause  of  the  misunderstanding  against this  great  Church,  which  stands  for  all  that  the  gospel  of  Jesus  Christ contains.

The singing is also described as being in perfect tune, indicating the importance placed on the quality and harmony of the music in enhancing the worship experience.

To transport 379 members of a singing group with their escorts, making a company of approximately 600, was a herculean task.  The difficulties of transportation and hotel accommodations had really just begun when they landed at Greenock.  But their tour, as you all know, proved to be successful beyond our fondest hopes.  At every concert they were given an ovation. Elder Richard L. Evans especially, who gave the spoken word, Elder Lester F. Hewlett, president of the choir, the directors, the organists, and every member of the choir deserve the highest praise.  The dignified attitude of the group as a whole, their comely deportment, their evident sincerity of purpose, their responsiveness, won the audience even before they started to sing.

"If I were a voice—a persuasive voice That could travel the wide world through, I would fly on the beams of the morning light, And speak to men with a gentle might, And tell them to be true.

However, as the light of truth dawned in their hearts, these earnest followers set about to give the gospel to the world—"twelve simple men, with only the wind to bear them over the seas, with only a few pence in their pockets, and a shining faith in their hearts. They fell far short of their ideal, their words were twisted and mocked, and false temples were built over their bones, in praise of a Christ they would have rejected. And yet, by the light of their inspiration many of the world's loveliest things were created, and many of the world's finest minds inspired."
