The choir in the great cathedral sang the stirring words of Luther's moving hymn, "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God." They repeated the peaceful assurance of the twenty-third Psalm, "The Lord Is My Shepherd"  Ps. 23:1 They gave voice to the battle hymn of the faithful, "Onward, Christian Soldiers." They reverently sang the prayer of John Henry Newman, "Lead, kindly Light, amid th'encircling gloom; Lead thou me on!" 

>>> This paragraph describes the choir singing various hymns and psalms. Singing is a form of worship that is inherently not quiet. It involves raising one’s voice to express devotion and faith.

It was written more than a century ago by a man of humble circumstances who lived in Sheffield, England. He worked in the steel mills and was discharged because he joined the Mormon Church. But there burned in his heart a great and fervent testimony; and out of an overflowing spirit of gratitude, he penned these marvelous lines. They have become a grateful expression of appreciation for millions over the earth. I myself have heard them sung in 21 different languages as a reverent prayer of thanksgiving for divine revelation. 

>>> This paragraph talks about a man who wrote lines of gratitude that have been sung in 21 different languages as a prayer of thanksgiving for divine revelation. Again, singing is a form of worship that is not quiet.

I love to hear children pray. I appreciate hearing parents pray for their children. I stand reverently before a father who in the authority of the holy priesthood lays his hands upon the head of a son or daughter at a time of serious decision and in the name of the Lord and under the direction of the Holy Spirit gives a father’s blessing. 

>>> This paragraph describes a father giving a blessing to his child. While this may not be loud, it is a verbal and therefore audible form of worship.

Every sacrament meeting ought to be a spiritual feast. It ought to be a time for meditation and introspection, a time for singing songs of praise to the Lord, a time of renewing one’s covenants with him and our Eternal Father, and a time for hearing the word of the Lord with reverence and appreciation. 

>>> This paragraph mentions that every sacrament meeting should be a time for singing songs of praise to the Lord. Singing songs of praise is a form of worship that is not quiet.

I do not equate my body with His in its refinement, in its capacity, in its beauty and radiance. His is eternal. Mine is mortal. But that only increases my reverence for Him. I worship Him “in spirit and in truth.” I look to Him as my strength. I pray to Him for wisdom beyond my own. I seek to love Him with all my heart, might, mind, and strength. His wisdom is greater than the wisdom of all men. His power is greater than the power of nature, for He is the Creator Omnipotent. His love is greater than the love of any other, for His love encompasses all of His children, and it is His work and His glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of His sons and daughters of all generations (see  Moses 1:39 

>>> This paragraph describes the act of prayer, which is a form of worship that involves verbal communication with God. While it may not be loud, it is not silent.

On one occasion we invited a family whom we had met while tracting. With great expectation we as missionaries stood by the door to welcome them. There was the usual convivial spirit in the hall, with the members talking noisily one with another. When this family came into the room, they quietly moved toward some chairs, knelt for a moment, and closed their eyes in a word of prayer. They then sat in an attitude of reverence amidst all the commotion. 

>>> This paragraph describes a situation where members were talking noisily with one another in the hall. This indicates that there are times during Latter-day Saint gatherings when quiet is not required.

>>> (Previous two paragraphs): These paragraphs suggest that while reverence and respect are important in Latter-day Saint worship practices, not all aspects of these practices are meant to be quiet. Prayer and fellowship are examples of these practices. However, it’s important to note that the context and the spirit in which these practices are carried out are crucial to understanding their purpose and significance.

This remarkable choir seated behind me is known across the world as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Everywhere that it has been heard—and those places are numerous—its song has been a hymn of peace, of love, of reverence, and of humanity, given in anthem of praise to the Almighty and His Beloved Son. 

>>> This paragraph refers to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, a musical organization that performs hymns of peace, love, reverence, and humanity. The act of singing, especially in a choir, is a form of worship that is inherently not quiet. It involves raising one’s voice in song to express devotion and praise. This form of worship is meant to be heard and shared, creating a sense of community and shared devotion among those present. It’s a way of expressing faith and reverence in a communal and audible way.

From this pulpit may Thy name be spoken with reverence and love. May the name of Thy Son be constantly remembered with sacred declaration. May testimony of Thy divine work ring forth from here to all the world. May righteousness be proclaimed and evil denounced. May words of faith be spoken with boldness and conviction. May proclamations and declarations of doctrine ring forth to the nations. 

>>> This paragraph refers to the practice of speaking words of faith with boldness and conviction, proclaiming righteousness, denouncing evil, and making proclamations and declarations of doctrine to the nations. These practices involve verbal communication and are inherently not quiet. They are meant to be heard by others, spreading the message of faith and doctrine to a wider audience. This form of worship is about expressing faith and reverence in a communal and audible way, reinforcing the shared beliefs and values of the community.

To our brethren over there I extend our appreciation and invoke upon you the blessings of the Lord, that you may be encouraged in your faith, that you may be protected in your duties, and that you may have cause to rejoice in the midst of sorrow as you share with others the precious gift of the faith that is yours. God bless you, my dear brethren, this Sabbath day, as the sun rises over those distant embattled shores and you gather together to worship in the name of him whose peace must come, if peace is to come at all, even Jesus Christ. Amen. 

>>> This paragraph describes the practice of sharing faith with others, which inherently involves communication and is not a quiet activity. The act of sharing faith can involve speaking, teaching, and demonstrating faith in actions, all of which are audible or visible forms of expression.

With the tremendous growth of the Church we become increasingly aware of the great magnitude of the affairs of this the Lord's kingdom. We have a comprehensive program for the instruction of the family. We have organizations for youth, for children, for mothers and fathers. We have a vast missionary system, a tremendous welfare operation, probably the most extensive genealogical program in the world. We must build houses of worship, hundreds and thousands of them. We must operate hospitals, schools, seminaries, institutes. The ramifications of our activities now reach around the world. All of this is the business of the Church. Sometimes the tendency is to handle it as we would ordinary business. But it is more than an organization of enterprises. It is more than a social body. These are but means to the accomplishment of its one true purpose. 

>>> This paragraph mentions the various activities and programs of the Church, including instruction of the family, organizations for different age groups and roles, missionary work, welfare operations, and genealogical programs. These activities involve interaction, teaching, and service, which are not quiet practices.

I have been impressed with the sacrifices of our people to construct houses of worship in many parts of the world, but I think I have never been so deeply touched as in witnessing the response to a suggestion made two years ago by our Vietnam zone president, a military officer. He suggested that our brethren, who were already paying their tithing, contribute their combat pay differential to a building fund. This represents the extra amount given men for battle duty. More than $3,000 was contributed by men of the Saigon Branch on a single Sunday, and more than $18,000 was given throughout Vietnam in 30 days. Where in all the world would you find a better expression of faith than that of these soldiers, airmen, and marines, who have given to the cause of peace that money paid them for the risks of battle? 

>>> This paragraph talks about the act of contributing to a building fund, which is a form of worship through service and sacrifice. While the act of giving may be quiet, the impact and the communal effort it represents are not.

1973_A_hinckley_the_true_strength_of_the_church.txt

My beloved associates in this great work, I never come into this Tabernacle without thinking of the devotion and sacrifice of our pioneer fathers who constructed it as a house of God. They dedicated and consecrated it to worship and the teaching of truth. A great and sacred trust is placed in us, as we occupy this pulpit, to speak words of faith. To that end I humbly seek the direction of the Holy Spirit. 

>>> Here, the act of speaking words of faith from the pulpit is mentioned. This is an inherently audible activity, meant to be heard by the congregation.

1975_A_hinckley_the_symbol_of_christ.txt

I replied that the lives of our people must become the only meaningful expression of our faith and, in fact, therefore, the symbol of our worship. 

>>> This paragraph suggests that the lives of the people, their actions and expressions of faith, are the symbols of their worship. This implies active, visible, and audible expressions of faith and worship, not just quiet, internal ones.

>>> (Previous 5 paragraphs): In all these instances, worship is expressed in ways that involve communication, interaction, service, and active demonstration of faith, which are not quiet activities. They are meant to be shared with others, reinforcing the communal aspect of worship in the Latter-day Saint tradition.

I would like to say thank-you to the choir for that beautiful song of worship, which I hope will serve as something of a frame into which I can place my remarks. These past six months have been a wonderful season for us as a Church. Last spring we ushered in the 150th anniversary of the organization. On April 6th, when we were similarly convened in general conference, we spanned most of the continent and reached across a century and a half of history when we spoke from the humble birthplace of the Church to the vast congregation assembled in this Tabernacle. Since then, with music, with dancing, with drama we have portrayed the epic story of the building of Zion in the latter days. 

>>> This paragraph describes the practice of singing, dancing, and drama as part of the worship, which are inherently expressive and not quiet activities. These forms of worship involve communication and expression, which are audible and visible.

We shall continue the great work of strengthening our people wherever they may be found in the nations of the earth. We shall give encouragement to those who are weak in the faith. We shall try to teach them by example and precept. We shall work together in the spirit of charity and love one for another. We shall go on building houses of worship across the world, where our people may gather together and strengthen one another as they unitedly worship the Lord.

How shall our people keep themselves unspotted from the world unless they develop within themselves the spiritual strength and capacity to resist temptation that is so rampant everywhere we go these days? And where shall they develop such discipline? I think the meaning of this revelation is clear: they shall develop such discipline of self and such desire to live above the stains of the world in their communion with the Lord as worshipers in sacrament meetings. 

>>> Here, the act of worshipping in sacrament meetings is mentioned. This is an inherently communal activity, meant to be shared with others, reinforcing the communal aspect of worship in the Latter-day Saint tradition.

Now another matter: It was my privilege to preside over the 150th stake of the Church which was created in 1945, 115 years after the Church was organized. Now, less than forty years later, there are 1,458 stakes, almost a tenfold increase in the number of stakes in Zion; 378 new wards and branches were organized during 1983, bringing the total at the close of the year to nearly 14,000. Small wonder that we must construct so many new buildings in which to house the Latter-day Saints for worship and instruction.

We need, every one of us needs, to pause from the hectic pace of our lives and to reflect upon things sacred and divine. I recall that when I was a missionary in London, England, more than fifty years ago, we held our meetings in the Battersea town hall, which we rented. The floors were hard, and we sat on chairs. Every time a chair moved there was a noise. But this was not the worst aspect of the situation. Far worse was the noisy socializing of the members of the branch. On one occasion we invited a family whom we had met while tracting. With great expectation we as missionaries stood by the door to welcome them. There was the usual convivial spirit in the hall, with the members talking noisily one with another. When this family came into the room, they quietly moved toward some chairs, knelt for a moment, and closed their eyes in a word of prayer. They then sat in an attitude of reverence amidst all the commotion. Frankly, I was embarrassed. They had come to what they regarded as a worship service, and they behaved themselves accordingly. At the close of the meeting they left quietly, and when we next met they spoke of their disappointment in what they had experienced. I have never forgotten that.

>>> This paragraph describes the socializing of the members of the branch, which involves talking and interaction. This is not a quiet activity as it involves communication among the members.

Music, of course, is an important factor. Our buildings for the most part are equipped with organs, which when properly played, can add much to the worship atmosphere of the service. The singing of hymns and the rendition of selections from the great sacred oratorios by ward choirs all enhance the spirit of worship. 

>>> This paragraph talks about the role of music in worship. Music, whether it’s from organs or the singing of hymns and renditions of sacred oratorios by ward choirs, is an audible form of worship that enhances the spirit of worship.

I am thankful that the day has come, at last, when for the Latter-day Saints in the United States and Canada the payment of honest tithes and generous offerings will provide the means for facilities and activities whereby we may worship together, learn together, and socialize together for group and individual benefit. 

>>> Here, the act of socializing together for group and individual benefit is mentioned. Socializing is an inherently communal and interactive activity, which involves communication and is not a quiet practice.

>>> This paragraph cites a verse from the Bible (Revelation 14:6-7) that mentions worshiping God with a loud voice. This suggests that worship in this context is not meant to be quiet, but rather vocal and expressive.

The shout was an expression of worship. It was an expression of gratitude. This was an unequaled day of thanksgiving. This was a day of which these people had dreamed for almost forty years. You have heard and read and seen much recently concerning that forty-year struggle.

But there are still those in large numbers who wish to be seated where they can see in person those who are speaking and participating in other ways. The structure we envision will not be a sports arena. It will be a great hall with fixed seating and excellent acoustics. It will be a dedicated house of worship, and that will be its primary purpose. It will be fashioned in such a way that only a portion or the entire hall may be used, according to need. It will accommodate not only religious services, but will serve other Church purposes, such as the presentation of sacred pageants and things of that kind. It will also accommodate some community cultural events that will be in harmony with its purpose. 

>>> This paragraph talks about the envisioned structure that will accommodate not only religious services but also the presentation of sacred pageants and community cultural events. These activities, especially pageants, involve performances that are typically not quiet.

The building will seat some 21,000, plus 1,000 in the theater which will be a part of it. Through the generations that lie ahead, it will ring with the voices of the prophets. It will be primarily a house of worship. But it will also be a place of art.

>>> Here, the future building is described as a place that will ring with the voices of the prophets. This implies that the worship practices in this building will involve audible expressions, which are not quiet.

As we contemplate these things, we think of our brothers and sisters in distant lands. We have met hundreds of thousands of you, have looked into your faces, have felt of your spirits. You are so very precious to this work. The Lord has gathered you “one of a city, and two of a family,” as prophesied by Jeremiah. He is teaching you with pastors after His own heart (see  Jer. 3:14–15 We pray for you, we visit you, we respect and admire you, we love you. We are all part of a great family—10 million strong—worshiping with one heart and one voice at the feet of our Master, the Son of God. Wherever you are, no matter how distant, you have the opportunity of participating in this conference. You will receive it by satellite in very many places. You will receive it by videotape in some places that cannot be reached by satellite. And for a few in faraway places, you will have it as the written word in our Church magazines.

Then the mops came out and the polishing cloths, and before nightfall that Saturday evening, the building had been made ready for worship services on the Sabbath.

At the general conference of April 1996, I said: “I regret that many who wish to meet with us in the Tabernacle this morning are unable to get in. There are very many out on the grounds. This unique and remarkable hall, built by our pioneer forebears and dedicated to the worship of the Lord, comfortably seats about 6,000. Some of you seated on those hard benches for two hours may question the word comfortably. 

>>> Here, the speaker mentions a large gathering of people in the Tabernacle for a general conference. Such a large gathering is likely to involve collective worship practices that are not quiet.

“My heart reaches out to those who wish[ed] to get in and could not be accommodated. About a year ago I suggested to the Brethren that perhaps the time has come when we should study the feasibility of constructing another dedicated house of worship on a much larger scale that would accommodate three or four times the number who can be seated in this building” (in Conference Report, Apr. 1996, 88–89; or Ensign, May 1996, 65).

And now today, as another significant accomplishment of this millennial year, we dedicate this great Conference Center. It is a unique and remarkable building.

We renew our relationships as members of this large family of Latter-day Saints who live in many lands, who speak a variety of languages, who come out of difficult cultures, who even look different. And we recognize that we are all one, each a son or daughter of our Father in Heaven.

To accommodate this growth we must, of necessity, continue to build houses of worship. We now have, at some stage, 451 meetinghouses of various sizes under construction in many parts of the earth. This tremendous building program is phenomenal. I know of nothing to equal it. Our structures are beautiful. They add to the ambience of any community in which they stand. They are well maintained. We have had long experience in constructing houses of worship, and out of that vast experience we are producing better buildings than have ever previously been constructed in the Church. They combine beauty with great utility. If they look much the same, it is because that is intended. By following tried and tested patterns we save millions of dollars while meeting the needs of our people.

My beloved brothers and sisters, what a miracle these conferences are. There is nothing to compare with them anywhere in the world. When you think that we gather here in this great conference hall and that what we say is carried all across the world so that people on every continent worship together the living God, it is truly and wonderfully a miracle. All who have spoken have done so very well. We wish there had been time to hear from all of the General Authorities. Unfortunately, that has not been possible. Representatives of the auxiliary organizations have inspired us with their messages.

Our people are more faithful in attendance at their meetings, and since our last conference a very substantial number of them have had opportunity to demonstrate their love for neighbor as well as for God. In the floods which we have experienced in this area, there has been an unexcelled expression of neighborliness and Christian service. A woman who was not a member of the Church was interviewed on television and said, “I am not a Mormon, but I have come to know who my bishop is.” She went on to speak with unrestrained appreciation for her neighbors, who, almost entirely Latter-day Saints, had been as generous in their help toward her as they had been in their help toward one another. There is a stake not far from here where the members of each ward undertook the repair or replacement of a home damaged or lost in the flood. Hundreds of thousands of sandbags were filled and put in place. There were, of course, those not of the Church doing likewise, but all concerned have spoken with high praise for the Church organization which was able to muster forces so rapidly and so effectively.

Yesterday we sustained two of our Brethren in this sacred calling, thus, after they are ordained, filling the Council of the Twelve Apostles. I want to give you my testimony that they were chosen and called by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. There was much of prayer concerning this matter. There was discussion with President Kimball, the prophet of the Lord in our day, and a clear statement from him, for his is the prerogative in these matters. There was a clear and distinct impression, what I choose to call the whisperings of the Holy Spirit, concerning those who should be selected to assume this most important and sacred responsibility. These who have been called are men of experience in the world and in the Church. They are men of learning and achievement in their respective professions, who have received the accolades of praise from their peers and from many who have admired them from near and far. But this is not why they were chosen.

I wish that anyone who has any doubt concerning the strength and power of this cause could have had the experiences that I have had in recent months in these dedicatory services in the United States, in Asia and Australia, in Mexico, Central America, and South America, in Europe and Africa. I have looked into the faces of tens of thousands of Latter-day Saints. Their skins are of varying colors and hues. But their hearts beat as one with testimony and conviction concerning the truth of this great restored work of God. I have heard their testimonies spoken with sincerity. I have listened to their prayers. I have heard them lift their voices in anthems of praise. I have seen their tears of gratitude. I have known of their sacrifices made in appreciation for the blessings that have come to them.

May I say concerning this great Tabernacle Choir, which has sung for us today, that it has become an institution in the Church and has become, as expressed by a great national leader, a national treasure. They are dedicated and wonderful people, skillfully led and directed by good and able leaders, who sing the glories of God each week to a vast audience from sea to shining sea across this land and have been doing so for sixty years. Last July that anniversary was celebrated here, again in this Tabernacle. Think of it—six decades without an interruption of singing as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, representatives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There is nothing like it in the history of broadcasting in this nation or in any other nation.

Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever!

I spoke the other day with one of the most enthusiastic converts I have ever met. We were in Chicago for a big meeting which brought together some 20,000 members of the Church in the great United Center, where the Chicago Bulls play basketball. Randy Chiostri, a new member of the Church, drove us about while we were there. All during those long rides in the Chicago traffic he was talking about missionary work, praising the Church as the most wonderful institution in the world, talking of the gospel and the plan of salvation as the greatest thing that had ever come into his life. Randy’s introduction to the Church came when he dated Nancy. He took her to dinner. On the first date she said she drank no liquor. She would not take wine. How curious, he thought. She said it was against her faith. Smoking was also against her faith. Her faith became the subject of their conversations.
