Parents,  in  the  first  place,  whether they  do  it  or  not,  should  love  and  respect  each  other,  and  treat  each  other with  respectful  decorum  and  kindly regard  all  the  time.  The  husband should  treat  his  wife  with  the  utmost courtesy  and  respect.  The  husband should  never  insult  her,  he  should  never speak  slightingly  of  her,  but  should  always hold  her  in  highest  esteem  in the home,  in  the  presence  of  their  children. We  do  not  always  do  it,  perhaps; some  of  us,  perhaps,  do  not  do  it at  all.  But  nevertheless  it  is  true that  we  ought  to  do  it.  The  wife,  also should  treat  the  husband  with  the greatest  respect  and  courtesy.  Her words  to  him  should  not  be  keen  and cutting  and  sarcastic.  She  should  not cast  slurs  or  insinuations  at  him.  She should  not  nag  him.  She  should  not  try to  arouse  his  anger  or  to  make  things unpleasant  about  the  home.  The  wife should  be  a  joy  to  her  husband;  and she  should  live  and  conduct  herself  at home  so  that  the  home  will  be  the  most joyous,  the  most  blessed  place  on  earth to  her  husband.  This  should  be  the condition  of  the  husband  and  the  wife, the  father  and  the  mother  within the  sacred  precincts  of  that  holy place,  the  home.  Then  it  will  be easy  for  the  parents  to  instil  into  the hearts  of  their  little  children,  oiot  only love  for  their  fathers  and  their  mothers, not  only  respect  and  courtesy  toward their  parents,  but  love  and  courtesy and  deference  between  the  children  at home.  The  little  brothers  will  respect their  little  sisters.  The  little  boys  will respect  one  another.  The  little  girls will  respect  each  other,  and  the  girls and  boys  will  respect  each  other,  and treat  each  other  with  that  love,  that deference  and  respect  that  should  be observed  in  the  home  on  the  part  of  the little  children.  Then  it  will  be  easy for  the  Sunday  School  teacher  to  continue the  training  of  the  child  under  the hallowed  influence  of  the  Sabbath school;  and  the  child  will  be  tractable and  easily  led,  because  the  foundation of  a  correct  education  has  been  laid in  the  heart  and  mind  of  the  child  at home.  The  teacher  can  then  help  the little  children  brought  up  under  these proper  influences,  to  render  respect  and courtesy  to  all  men  and  especially  to the  unfortunate,  the  aged  and  the  infirm. If  we  could  only  bring  up  our children  in  this  way  at  home,  and  this home  influence  be  extended  in  the Sabbath  schools  as  well  as  in  the  day schools,  it  would  not  be  long  before children  would  meet  a  cripple  in  the street  with  reverence  and  pity.  They would  express  the  very  picture  of  sympathy In  their  faces,  and  their  souls  full of  love  and  sympathy  would  go  out for  the  unfortunate.  How  is  it  today? Too  often  it  is  the  case  that  we see  a  poor  half-demented  person,  the poor  cripple,  the  aged  and  infirm,  perhaps the  ill-clad  and  uncanny  passing along  and  the  boys  in  the  street  are abusing  them,  throwing  snow  balls  at them,  perchance  throwing  stones  at them,  and  doing  anything  in  their  power to  annoy  and  make  their  miserable lives  still  more  miserable;  and  this  because of  the  want  of  respect,  of  sympathy and  love  that  they  should  feel for  the  unfortunate.

The  Lord  bless  Zion.  May  peace abide  with  you,  my  brethren  and my  sisters.  God  bless  you  in  every capacity  in  which  you  are  called to  act  in  life,  and  be  with  you bv  the  presence  and  power  of  His Spirit,  guide  you  into  all  truth,  put into  your  hearts  the  spirit  of  prayer and  true  devotion,  and  that  faith which  cannot  be  moved.  God  lives, and  Jesus  is  the  Christ,  the  Savior of  the  world.  Joseph  Smith  is  a Prophet  of  God — living,  not  dead; for  his  name  will  never  perish.  The angel  that  visited  him  and  declared God's  message  unto  him,  told  him that  his  name  should  be  held  for good  and  for  evil  throughout  the world.  This  prediction  was  made in  the  days  of  his  youth,  before  the Church  was  organized,  and  before there  was  any  prospect  of  that  which has  since  been  accomplished.  The declaration  was  made,  notwithstanding it  then  seemed  an  absolute impossibility;  but  from  the day  it  was  spoken  until  this  moment, and  from  now  on  until  the winding-up  scene,  the  name  of  Joseph Smith,  the  Prophet  of  the  nineteenth century,  has  been,  is  being and  will  be  heralded  abroad  to  the nations  of  the  earth,  and  will  be held  in  honor  or  contempt  by  the people  of  the  world.  But  the  honor in  which  it  is  now  held  by  a  few will  by  and  by  be  so  increased  that his  name  shall  be  held  in  reverence and  honor  among  the  children  of men  as  universally  as  the  name  of the  Son  of  God  is  held  today;  for he  did  and  is  doing  the  work  of the  Master.    He  laid  the  foundations  in  this  dispensation  for  the restoration  of  the  principles  that were  taught  by  the  Son  of  God,  who for  these  principles  lived,  and taught,  and  died,  and  rose  from the  dead.  Therefore  I  say,  as  the name  of  the  Son  of  God  shall  be held  in  reverence  and  honor,  and in  the  faith  and  love  of  men,  so will  the  name  of  Joseph  Smith eventually  be  held  among  the  children of  men,  gaining  prestige,  increasing in  honor,  and  commanding respect,  and  reverence  until  the world  shall  say  that  he  was  a  servant and  Prophet  of  God.  The Lord  God  Omnipotent  reigneth. Peace  on  earth,  goodwill  to  man, is  the  proclamation  that  Joseph  the Prophet  made,  and  that  is  the  same as  his  Master,  the  Lord  Jesus Christ,  made  to  the  world.  That  is the  mission  we  are  trying  to  fulfill, and  the  proclamat'on  we  are  seeking to  make  to  the  world  today.  It is  the  mission  that  these  young men  have  been  chosen  to  proclaim, and  be  witnesses  of  to  the  nations of  the  earth.  It  is  their  duty  to  see to  it  that  this  proclamation  and  this Gospel  of  peace  and  goodwill  shall be  sent  to  every  nation,  and  kindred, and  tongue,  and  people  under the  whole  heavens.  God  bless Israel,  is  my  earnest  prayer  in  the name  of  Jesus.  Amen.

I  desire  to  thank  the  good  brethren and  sisters  who  have  attended this  conference,  and  if  the  time would  permit,  without  interfering too  much  with  your  desire  to  return to  your  homes,  I  would  like  to  make a  simple  suggestion  or  two  to  our Relief  Societies,  to  our  Young Women's  Mutual  Improvement  Associations, Primary  Associations, and  our  Sunday  School,  and  Religion Class  teachers,  the  presidents of  stakes  and  their  counselors,  and the  high  counselors  throughout Zion,  and  the  bishops  and  counselors, and  ward  teachers  throughout the  Church,  that  they  set  their faces  like  flint  against  every  spirit of  apostasy,  every  kind  of  evil,  intemperance, the  violation  of  the Sabbath  day ;  and  hold  in  reverence that  which  is  sacred  in  the  eyes  of the  Lord,  and  should  be  held  sacred by  all  Latter-day  Saints ;  to  hold sacred  also  all  and  every  divine  and human  right ;  to  do  unto  all  men  as we  would  that  they  should  do  unto us,  and  set  an  example,  as  members of  the  Church  that  will  be  worthy of  emulation  by  all  men  and  women in  the  world.  I  want  to  say  to  our Relief  Societies,  our  Young  Ladies' Mutual  Improvement  Associations and'  our  Primary  Associations  that I  desire  and  sincerely  hope  they  will set  their  faces  like  flint  against every  immoral  thing,  including  the prevailing  habit  of  card-playing,  of unbecoming  fashions  in  dressing,  of indecent  exposure  of  the  human form  divine  to  the  lecherous  gaze  of men ;  that  they  clothe  themselves  in decency,  both  in  public  and  in  private, and  that  they  keep  sacred those  things  which  have  been  conferred upon  them  in  holy  places.  I ask  this,  and  I  would  suggest  to  our Relief  Societies,  Young  Ladies' Improvement  Associations,  and  Primary Associations,  that  when  you find  members  of  your  boards  indulging in  things  which  are  not right,  call  them  to  order,  admonish them ;  be  gentle  and  kind,  of  course, and  forbearing  and  patient ;  but  unless they  will  conform  to  the  rules of  these  associations  to  give  out  a moral  and  wholesome  influence  to the  young  people  of  Israel,  let  them be  dropped  and  others  who  will  be more  exemplary  chosen  and  put  in their  places.  I  expect  that  my  sisters will  listen  to  this  counsel,  for it  is  not  mine;  it  is  the  counsel  of the  spirit  and  letter  of  the  word  of God  as  we  have  it  in  the  divine records ;  it  is  God's  will,  and  those who  are  entrusted  with  these  imporant  duties  in  the  Church  should be  vigilant  in  guarding  the  welfare, the  happiness,  and  good  name  and character  of  the  daughters  of  Zion. I  want  presidents  of  stakes  and  their counselors  to  so  live  their  religion that  they  can  say,  consistently,  to the  people  of  their  stakes,  "Come and  follow  me."  I  desire  that  the bishops  in  all  the  wards  will  set  an example  before  their  people  that they  will  feel  proud  to  emulate  ;  and that  when  a  man  having  authority in  the  Church  stands  up  to  teach  his people  that  the  people  will  know, "He  practises  what  he  preaches ; and,  therefore,  his  example  and  precepts are  in  force."  We  would  like this:  and  we  hope  that  vou  will honor  the  Sabbath  day  and  keep  it holv,  that  vou  will  reverence  the authority  of  the  Priesthood,  and magnify  it  by  good  works  ;  that  you will  observe  the  covenants  you  have entered  into  in  sacred  places  and keep  them  inviolate  ;  that  you  will be  Latter-day  Saints  in  verv  deed : that  you  mav  be  indeed  the  light  of the  world,  that  is  not  and  cannot be  hidden  under  a  bushel,  nor  in some  dark  corner,  and  the  salt  of the  earth.  We  are  coming  out  in full  sight  of  the  world.  The  eye  of God,  and  the  eye  of  man,  is  upon this  people.  We  cannot  hide  ourselves from  them.  It  behooves  us to  speak  right,  to  think  right,  to  do right,  and  to  work  righteousness  in every  capacity  in  which  we  are called  to  act,  in  private  and  in  public, that  it  may  be  said  of  us,  "They are  worthy  of  their  standing  and name,  as  members  of  the  Church of  Jesus  Christ  bf  Latter-day Saints,  the  highest  honor  that  can be  given  to  man.

It is with humility, desiring that the Spirit of the Lord may rest upon you, my hearers, as well as upon myself, that I arise to address you. I am requested to "blow the Gospel trumpet." I do not know that I shall be able to make myself heard by this large congregation, unless all keep quiet and exercise that faith which it is our privilege to do when assembled in a worshiping capacity. 

>>> This paragraph suggests that the act of preaching or ‘blowing the Gospel trumpet’ is a form of worship that is not quiet. The speaker expresses concern about being heard by a large congregation, implying that the act of preaching involves speaking out loud. The phrase ‘blow the Gospel trumpet’ is metaphorical and suggests proclaiming the Gospel message loudly and clearly. This is a form of worship that is active, vocal, and public, contrasting with quieter forms of worship such as silent prayer or meditation. The speaker also emphasizes the need for the congregation to exercise faith, suggesting that active participation and engagement are important aspects of this worship practice.

Greatly  to  my  surprise,  I  have  been requested  to  occupy  a  few  moments. I  need  not  repeat  the  petition  of  my brother  who  has  just  sat  down,  that  I may  have  the  sympathy  and  the  prayers of  the  Saints,  for  I  certainly  desire and  need  them.  A  certain  incident  was brought  forcibly  to  my  mind  while Brother  MoMurrin  was  talking  to  us. Not  long  ago  President  Snow  and  his party  attended  a  Stake  conference,  and I  noticed  that  the  choir  was  made  up almost  entirely  of  young  ladies.  There were  perhaps  two  young  men.  One young  man  led  the  choir,  and  I  do  not remember  clearly  whether  there  was one  young  man  in  the  choir  or  not  besides the  leader;  but  all  the  rest  were young  ladies.  It  was  a  beautiful  choir, and  they  sang  beautifully,  but  the  absense  of  male  voices  was  very  conspicuous, notwithstanding.  I  believe during  one  of  the  services  the  leader  of the  choir  was  absent,  and  one  of  the young  ladies  had  to  step  forward  and lead  it.  I  inquired  why  it  was  that  the young  men  were  not  more  numerous in  that  company  of  singers,  and  was told  that  the  young  men  considered  it was  too  effeminate,  too  womanly,  for them  to  engage  in  the  occupation  of singing.  I  presume  they  might  have felt  more  at  home  shaking  the  quilts, sweeping  the  floors,  and  helping  to wash  the  dishes.  I  can  remember  when I  was  a  little  boy,  hearing  my  father sing.  I  do  not  know  how  much  of  a singer  he  was,  for  at  that  time  I  was not  capable  of  judging  as  to  the  quality of  his  singing,  but  the  hymns  he sang  became  familiar  to  me,  even  in the  days  of  my  childhood.  I  believe that  I  can  sing  them  still,  although  I am  not  much  of  a  singer.  When  young men  go  out  into  the  world  to  preach the  Gospel,  they  will  find  it  very  beneficial for  them  to  know  how  to  sing the  songs  of  Zion.  I  repeat  the  admonition and  request  made  by  Brother McMurrin,  who  has  recently  returned from  a  lengthy  mission  to  Europe,  that the  young  men  who  are  eligible  to preach  the  Gospel,  and  who  are  liable to  be  called  into  the  missionary  field, begin  at  once  to  improve  their  talent to  sing,  and  do  not  think  it  is  beneath their  dignity  to  join  the  choirs  of  the wards  in  which  they  live  and  learn  how to  sing.  When  we  listen  to  this  choir, under  the  leadership  of  Brother  Stephens, we  listen  to  music,  and  music  is truth.  Good  music  is  gracious  praise of  God.  It  is  delightsome  to  the  ear, and  it  is  one  of  our  most  acceptable methods  of  worshipping  God.  And  those who  sing  in  this  choir  and  in  all  the choirs  of  the  Saints,  should  sing  with the  spirit  and  with  the  understanding. They  should  not  sing  merely  because it  is  a  profession,  or  because  they  have a  good  voice;  but  they  should  sing  also because  they  have  the  spirit  of  it  and can  enter  into  the  spirit  of  prayer  and praise  to  God  who  gave  them  their sweet  voices.  My  soul  is  always  lifted up  and  my  spirit  cheered  and  comforted when  I  hear  good  music.  I  rejoice in  it  very  much  indeed.  Now,  I would  like  to  encourage  the  young  men of  Israel  to  learn  to  sing,  and  especially those  young  men  of  whom  I  have  been speaking.  I  would  not  like  to  tell  you just  where  they  live,  because  it  might be  considered  a  little  personal,  but  it was  down  south;  it  was  not  very  far down  south  either.  It  was  somewhere near  Sanpete  valley.  I  want  the  young men  of  Sanpete  Valley  to  learn  how  to sing,  so  that  when  we  go  down  to  hold conference  there  again  we  can  have  the young  men  joining  with  the  young  women in  the  choir,  and  not  leave  the young  women  to  do  all  the  singing. This  might  apply  also  to  all  the  other counties;  especially  should  it  apply  to those  counties  or  Stakes  of  Zion  where the  young  men  think  it  is  beneath  their dignity   and    their   manhood   to  learn how  to  sing.  I  hope  they  will  rise above  such  a  foolish  notion  as  this.

In  addition  to  this  I  am  happy  to say  to  this  congregation  and  to  all  the world  so  far  as  my  words  may  go,  that we  have  taken  the  liberty,  and  we  have taken  pride,  and  still  feel  proud  of  the. opportunity  that  has  been  afforded  us, and  of  the  ability  that  we  have possessed  to  accomplish  it — to  render aid  to  many  of  our  missions abroad  in  the  purchase  and  in the  establishment  of  mission  headquarters and  the  building  of  churches  In which  they  can  meet  to  worship  God, and  to  which  they  will  not  be  ashamed to  invite  the  stranger  to  come  and  join with  them.  We  have  used  some  of  the tunings  of  the  people  for  this  purpose, and  we  think  that  when  the Church  desires  to  call  us  to  an account  for  matters  of  this  kind  there  is a  way  by  which  they  can  reach  it which  will  not  occasion  any  noise  or confusion  and  I  trust  without  any misunderstanding  whatever.  I  believe we  can  come  to  a  perfect understanding  with  reference  to these  matters.  We  have  been  able,  too, to  purchase  quite  a  tract  of  land  in Jackson  county  adjacent  to  the  site that  was  chosen  by  the  Prophet  Joseph Smith  for  a  temple,  to  be  built some  day;  and  some  few  of  our  people have  generously  contributed  specially for  the  accomplishment  of  this  purpose, but  the  most  of  the  means  that  have been  employed  for  the  accomplishment of  this  object  have  necessarily  been taken  from  the  general  tithing  funds  of the  Church.  By  this  means  also  we have  been  able  to  secure  elegant  headquarters for  our  people  in  the Northern  States  mission;  we  have been  able  to  assist  the  Southern States  mission  to  obtain  headquarters; and  we  have  also  been  enabled  to  assist the  British  mission  to  obtain  a  comfortable home  and  headquarters,  where the  "Star"  that  has  been  published  for so  many  years,  can  continue  to  be  published for  the  advancement  of  the  work of  the  Latter-day  Saints  and  of  the Elders  in  the  British  mission.  We have  been  able  to  assist  largely in  the  erection  of  a  commodious house  of  worship  in  Copenhagen,  Denmark, also  In  Christiania,  Norway,  and also  in  Stockholm,  Sweden;  and  we have  assisted  also  in  obtaining  headquarters  for  our  people  who  live  upon many  of  the  islands  of  the  sea. We  have  secured  a  tract  of  land  upon the  Islands  of  Samoa  for  the  purpose  of gathering our  Saints  where  they  can receive  the  benefits  of  Church  organization, the  benefits  of  Sunday  schools, Mutual  Improvement  associations  and Sabbath  worship,  and  where  they  can be  taught  the  arts  of  industry  and  selfsupport.  We  have  assisted  our  people in  Australia  and  New  Zealand  in  a similar  way.  And  withall  we  have  met more  than  one-half  of  the  bonded  indebtedness of  the  Church;  and  we  are in  a  condition,  when  the  time  shall  be ripe  for  it,  provided  the  Saints  continue to  meet  their  obligations  in  their tithes  and  offerings,  to  pay  off  the remaining  portion  of  the  Church  indebtedness; when,  I  trust,  by  the  blessings of  the  Almighty,  the  Church of  Jesus  Christ  of  Latter-day  Saints will  see  a  day  in  which  it  will  be  absolutely free  from  debt  and  under  obligation to  no  man;  and  it  will  not  be long  before  this  consummation  is  realized if  we  continue  our  work  in  the future  as  we  have  done  it  in  the  past.

A  large  amount  of  means  has  been expended  in  the  erection  of  meetinghouses in  the  various  wards  and  stakes of  Zion,  and  the  Trustee-in-Trust  has been  called  upon  to  furnish  large  sums of  money  to  assist;  and  also,  in  many instances,  to  assist  the  people  in  the Creation  of  church  jshoolhouses  and houses  of  amusement.  We  would  like all  the  world  to  know  that  the  Church of  Jesus  Christ  of  Latter-day  Saints aims    not   only   to   provide    houses  of worship  for  its  members,  but  it  also aims  to  provide  houses  of  instruction and  houses  of  amusement  as  well,  that the  people  of  the  Church,  old  and young,  may  have  places  where  they can  assemble  in  the  dance,  in  concerts, in  musical  festivals,  and  in  intellectual feasts,  that  they  may  have  scope  for the  enjoyment  of  every  desire  of  their hearts  in  righteousness.  I  will  say  to you  that  the  Church  has  been  as  liberal in  these  matters  as  it  was  possible  to be  in  view  of  the  obligations  that  still rest  upon  the  Trustee-in-Trust.  Our Church  schools  are  increasing,  and the  demand  is  increasing  continually for  means  with  which  to  keep them  going,  and  also  for  the  purpose of  erecting  additional  buildings  to  accommodate the  children.  When  we tell  you  that  almost  every  Church school  throughout  the  land  is  filled  to overflowing,  you  may  perhaps  discern the  growth  of  the  people  of  God  and the  progress  and  advancement  of  our educational  institutions.  No  sooner is  one  building  completed  than  it  is  discovered that  it  is  too  small,  and  that more  room  is  required.  From  time  to time,  therefore,  we  have  to  assist  in enlarging  and  in  providing  accommodation for  our  children.  I  think  that  the Latter-day  Saints  will  be  able  to  discern in  this  fact  a  glorious  truth.  Zion is  growing,  and  interest  is  being  increased in  the  hearts  of  the  people  in proper  education  and  training,  to  the end  that  our  children  may  go  to  schools where  the  Bible  is  not  excluded,  where the  Book  of  Mormon  and  the  Book of  Doctrine  and  Covenants  are  admitted, and  where  true>  religion  may  be taught  as  well  as  letters  and  the  sciences and  arts.  The  Trustee-in-Trust  has also  assisted  largely  in  procuring  mission houses  in  Scandinavia,  in  Great Britain,  in  the  islands  of  the  sea,  and in  our  own  land  of  America.  We  are now  helping  to  build  a  place  of  worship and  a  dwelling-house  at  Papeete,  Tahiti. We  have  done  the  same  in  Samoa. Assistance  has  also  been  rendered to  the  New  Zealand  mission  for a  similar  purpose,  and  to  Australia  as well.     In  these  island  missions  we  are extending  aid  to  our  people  in  order  togivo  them  a  better  standing  and  wider influence,  that  they  may  gain  the  respect they  merit;  for,  as  a  rule,  the  people of  those  islands  are  very  poor.

>>> This paragraph describes the practice of singing in a choir as part of Latter-day Saint worship. The speaker expresses gratitude to the choir and encourages them to continue making melody in the worship of God. This suggests that singing in a choir is an active and audible form of worship, contrasting with quieter forms of worship. The speaker’s emphasis on the need for all to participate and the importance of singing in their worship indicates that this is a practice that is not supposed to be quiet.

>>> (About the previous three paragraphs): These practices are not supposed to be quiet because they involve active participation and are meant to be communal experiences. They are designed to engage the congregation and create a sense of community and shared worship. The noise and activity involved in these practices are seen as expressions of joy and worship, rather than disruptions to the worship experience.

The  Bishops  and  the  Lesser Priesthood  should  be  very  active and  energetic.  We  should  look  after our  boys  w'ho  have  been  ordained Deacons,  Teachers,  and  Priests in  the  Church.  We  should  find something  for  them  to  do  in  their callings.  Let  them  be  appointed  to active  labors  in  their  several spheres.  Put  forward  those  who have  not  had  experience  to  accompany those  who  have,  and  give  them something  to  do.  Let  the  Deacons not  only  assist  to  keep  the  meeting houses  in  repair  and  their  grounds in  proper  condition,  but  let  them  be set  to  work  to  look  after  the  welfare of  the  widows  and  fatherless, the  aged  and  the  poor.  Many  of our  young  men  who  are  idle, languishing  for  the  want  of  something to  do,  could  be  made  most useful  in  helping  the  poor  to  clean up  about  their  homes  and  make them  comfortable,  and  helping them  to  live  in  such  a  way  that  life would  be  pleasant  to  them.  There is  no  reason  why  the  members  of the  Lesser  Priesthood  should  not be  engaged  in  missions  and  labors of  this  kind.  Instead  of  calling  upon the  Trustee-in-trust  for  the tithing  to  pay  for  planting  trees to  ornament  the  grounds  of  the meeting  houses,  or  to  paint  the woodwork,  or  to  renovate  and cleanse  the  houses  of  worship,  to make  them  suitable  for  the  worship of  God, — call  the  Lesser  Priesthood to  the  work.  Give  them  something to  do  that  will  make  them  interested in  the  work  of  the  Lord,  and  above all  things  direct  their  energies  in such  a  way  that  they  will  be  helpful to  the  needy,  helpful  to  the  poor, helpful  to  themselves  and  to  the Church.  It  will  benefit  them  not only  as  regards  their  standing  in the  Church,  and  their  faith  in  the Priesthood  which  they  bear,  but  it will  help  them  to  become  better boys  at  home.  They  will  be  more dutiful  to  their  parents,  more  respectful to  their  brothers  and  sisters and  others.  They  will  become more  mindful  of  their  duties  at home  and  abroad.  This  is  in  the line  of  discipline,  of  instruction  and of  gaining  practical  experience.  Instead of  leaving  these  young  people, who  are  full  of  energy,  to  roam the  streets,  to  congregate  upon  the corners,  or  to  idle  away  their  time in  folly,  and  in  contracting,  perhaps foolish  habits  and  practices, give  them  something  to  do  that  wiil be  uplifting,  something  that  will be  enlarging  to  their  souls,  and  that will  be  an  instruction  to  them  that they  will  remember  all  their  days. 

>>> The first paragraph describes Latter-day Saint worship practices that are not supposed to be quiet. This paragraph discusses the active roles of the Bishops and the Lesser Priesthood, who are encouraged to be energetic and proactive in their duties. These duties include maintaining meeting houses, assisting the needy such as widows, the fatherless, and the poor, and engaging in missions. The emphasis on activity and engagement in these practices suggests they are not quiet or passive. The purpose of these practices is to foster interest in the work of the Lord, help the needy, and provide practical experience and discipline for the young members of the Church. This active participation contrasts with quiet worship practices, which typically involve silent prayer or meditation. The Latter-day Saint worship practices described here involve communal and service-oriented activities that require communication and collaboration, making them inherently not quiet.

We  will  not  say  anything  about a  long  list  of  non-tithepayers,  that we  have  recorded  in  the  archives  of the  Church,  of  those  holding  membership in  the  Church.  I  do  not  care to  make  enumerations  of  this  character, but  I  would  like  to  say  to  the Latter-day  Saints  who  are  tithe payers,  who  honor  this  law,  and who  provide  out  of  their  means, voluntarily,  the  revenues  necessary to  carry  on  the  work  of  the  Church — in  the  maintenance  of  temples,  in the  missionary  cause,  in  the  conduct and  maintenance  of  our  schools,  in assisting  to  build  our  meetinghouses and  other  adjuncts  to  our schools,  such  as  gymnasiums,  which have  become,  apparently,  a  very  urgent necessity  of  late,  and  also places  of  amusement.  For  we  must not  only  provide  places  of  worship for  the  youth  of  Zion,  as  well  as  for their  fathers  and  mothers,  but  we must  also  provide  and  find  places for  rational  amusement  for  our  children, in  order  that  they  may  be kept  under  proper  influences  and away  from  the  contaminating,  degrading, and  debasing  practices  too common  in  the  world,  with  reference to  and  in  connection  with  the amusements  of  the  people.  There  is one  thing  that  I  desire  to  say — not that  it  will  amount  to  anything,  I suppose  ;  but  it  will  be  a  satisfaction to  myself,  at  least,  to  speak  what  I feel  to  be  the  truth,  and  it  is  this : I  regret  most  deeply  the  sentiments that  are  expressed  by  the people  generally  with  reference  to their  choice  of  amusements.  We have  some  interest  in  the  old  Salt Lake  Theatre  here,  built  by  President Brigham  Young,  to  afford  a hisrh  class  of  amusement  that  would be  intelligible  and  entertaining,  interesting and  instructive  to  those who  desire  such  entertainment.  It has  been  conducted  along  these  lines for  many  years  in  as  high  class character  of  performances  as  it  was possible,  but  when  we  get  really high  class  performances  in  that  theatre the  benches  are  practically  empty, while  vaudeville  theatres,  where are  exhibitions  of  nakedness,  of  obscenity, of  vulgarity,  and  everything else  that  does  not  tend  to  elevate  the thought  and  mind  of  man,  will  be packed  from  the  pit  to  the  dome. When  you  have  performances  of  a high  class,  that  are  intellectual,  people do  not  largely  patronize  them ; but  when  you  bring  in  a  class  of performance  that  appeals  to  the  vulgar, the  sensual  and  evil  propensities of  men,  the  seats  are  full.  I  do not  speak  of  this  as  existing  merely here  in  Utah;  I  speak  of  it  as  a common  thing  throughout  all  the length  and  breadth  of  the  land.  It shows  a  degradation  of  sentiment, a  lowering  of  the  standards  of  intellectuality, of  purity  of  thought, of  nobility  of  desire  for  proper  association, of  the  people  generally.  I regret  this ;  I  am  sorry  for  it ;  and I  wish  to  say  to  the  Latter-day Saints  that  I  hope  they  will  distinguish themselves  by  avoiding  the necessity  of  being  classed  with  people who  prefer  the  vulgar  to  the chaste,  the  obscene  to  the  pure,  the evil  to  the  good,  and  the  sensual  to the  intellectual.  I  hope  that  we  will stand  by  our  principles,  abide  by  that which  is  good,  elevating  and  ennobling in  character,  rather  than  fall  in with  the  habits  of  the  world,  and patronize  that  which  is  beneath  the dignity  of  pure-minded  and  intelligent people. 

>>> The first paragraph describes Latter-day Saint worship practices that are not supposed to be quiet. It discusses the importance of providing places for rational amusement for children, in addition to places of worship. This suggests that these amusement activities, which are part of their worship practices, are likely to be lively and not quiet. The paragraph emphasizes the need for these activities to be under proper influences and away from degrading practices common in the world. This aligns with the Latter-day Saint belief in leading a wholesome and virtuous life. The paragraph also mentions the regret over the preference for vulgar and obscene amusements over high-class, intellectual performances. This indicates the importance placed on the quality and nature of these non-quiet activities in their worship practices.

I  also  desire  to  express  my  pleasure and  gratitude  and  '  thanks  to those  who  have  made  music  for  us, our  soloists,  our  singers  of  duets, the  choir,  and  the  leaders  of  our music.    We  thank  them  for  their efforts,  and  we  rejoice  and  enjoy exceedingly  their  harmony,  for  it is  a  part  of  the  gospel  of  Jesus Christ,  and  the  true  spirit  of  worship. We  will  now  sing,  "The Spirit  of  God  like  a  fire  is  burning," and  this  semi-annual  conference  of the  Church  of  Jesus  Christ  of  Latter-day Saints  will  be  adjourned for  six  months. 

>>> The fourth paragraph describes Latter-day Saint worship practices that are not supposed to be quiet. It mentions the making of music, including solos, duets, and choir performances, as part of their worship. Music is inherently a non-quiet activity and is described here as a source of joy and an integral part of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The paragraph also mentions the singing of a hymn, “The Spirit of God like a fire is burning,” which is another non-quiet worship practice. These musical elements of worship are likely to be lively and filled with harmony, contributing to a worship environment that is not solely focused on quiet practices. They are seen as a true expression of worship and are deeply appreciated within the community.

This reminds me of a remark that I was told a certain man—said to be learned in the law—had made in reference to the religion of the Latter-day Saints. He remarked something like this: "You believe in having joy; you claim that your religion is for the purpose of securing to you the greatest amount of joy. Now, on the back of this you deny yourselves of this, that and the other. Your people are called upon to deny their appetites, to control their passions, and to crucify the flesh, etc. My enjoyment consists in whatever I can get that is good to eat, to drink or wear; whatever ministers to my bodily ease, or comfort, to the gratification of my tastes and appetites. I deny myself nothing that I like or desire. Hence, I drink, I smoke, I chew, and I do as I please." He might have added, perhaps, "I curse and swear, I gamble, I commit whoredoms and take advantage of every circumstance I can to augment my pleasure and gratify my lust and my ambition, all these contribute pleasure to me and constitute my greatest joy and happiness." Such was the confessed moral status of this legal individual to whom I refer. But I consider (and I believe that every right-minded person will heartily agree with me), that such a conception of the object of human existence is groveling, vile and contemptible. No pure-minded person can perceive anything noble, exalted, pure or praiseworthy in a life so selfish, narrow and gross. There is nothing liberal or manly in such avowals, much less in the practical results of such a life, and coming from a man of years, of legal expe rience and knowledge to a youth with a view to misleading him, is infamous. Following this theory, we observe a man wallowing in the gutter, bloodshot, bloated, ragged, hideous and filthy, his family neglected at home and destitute, his children barefoot, naked or bundled in rags—and starving for food—objects of pity and disgust—without the shadow of a chance for mental improvement—with only the blighting, withering example of a besotted husband and father for their guiding star. And why all this? Because this misguided, fallen human creature is seeking joy in the gratification of his appetite! This theory may be followed in all its leadings, to similar and equally appalling results. No man is safe unless he is master of himself; and there is no tyrant so merciless or more to be dreaded than an uncontrollable appetite or passion. We will find that if we give way to the groveling appetites of the flesh and follow them up, that the end will be invariably bitter, injurious and sorrowful, both to the individual and society. It is hurtful in example as well as in its individual effects; dangerous and hurtful to the unwary; while the denial of these appetites—the crucifixion of the flesh, so to speak—and an aspiration for something noble; whenever possible, doing good to our fellow creatures, hoping for the future, laying up treasures in heaven where moth and rust cannot corrupt, and where thieves cannot break through and steal—all these things will bring everlasting happiness; happiness for this world and the world to come. If there is no pleasure in the world except that which we experience in the gratification of our physical desires—eating, drinking, gay associations, and the pleasures of the world—then the enjoyments of the world are bubbles; there is nothing in them, there is no lasting benefit or happiness to be derived from them. 

>>> The second paragraph describes Latter-day Saint worship practices that are not supposed to be quiet. It discusses the concept of joy in their religion and how it is not solely derived from quiet, introspective practices. Instead, it is also found in the active denial of certain appetites and passions, and in the pursuit of noble deeds and aspirations. This suggests that their worship involves active participation and personal sacrifice, which are not quiet activities. The practice of doing good to fellow creatures, hoping for the future, and laying up treasures in heaven are all active expressions of their faith.

It  was  not  so  in  the  days  of  Joseph; it  was  not  so  in  the  days  of Brigham  Young;  it  has  not  been  so since;  it  never  will  be  so.  The  direction of  this  work  among  the  people  of the  world  will  never  be  left  to  men. It  is  God's  work,  let  me  tell  you,  and I  hope  you  will  put  it  down  in  your memoranda,  and  do  not  forget  that it  is  the  Almighty  that  is  going to  do  this  work  and  consumrr.ate  it,  and  not  man.  No  man  shall have  the  honor  of  doing  it  nor  has any  man  ever  had  the  power  to  do  it of  himself.  Jt  is  God's  work.  If  it  had been  the  work  of  man,  we  would  have been  like  the  rest  of  the  world,  and  it would  not  have  been  true  of  us  that God  had  chosen  us  out  of  the world,  but  we  would  be  a  part of  it  and  "Hail  fellow,  well  met" with  it,  but  it  is  true  that  God  has chosen  us  out  of  the  world;  therefore we  are  not  of  it;  and  therefore  they hate  us  and  they  will  fight  us  and say  all  manner  of  evil  against  us falsely,  as  they  have  ever  done  from the  beginning.  And  they  will  continue to  seek  the  destruction  of  the Latter-day  Saints,  and  to  feel  toward us  in  the  future  as  they  have felt  in  the  past.  Now  don't  you  forget it  my  brethren  and  sisters.  When you  go  home,  if  you  have  not  been in  the  habit  of  doing  it  or  if  you  have neglected  your  duty,  when  you  go  home today  or  to  your  homes  in  distant  settlements, carry  this  injunction  with you:  Go  into  your  secret  chambers — go  into  your  prayer  rooms  and  there by  yourselves  or  with  your  families gathered  around  you,  bow  your  knees before  God  Almighty  in  praise  and  in thanksgiving  to  Him  for  His  merciful providence  that  has  been  over you  and  over  all  His  people  from  the inception  of  this  work  down  to  the present.  Remember  that  it  is  the gift  of  God  to  man,  that  it  is  His  power and  His  guiding  influence  that  has accomplished  what  we  see  has  been  accomplished. It  has  not  been  done  by the  wisdom  of  men.  It  is  proper  we should  give  honor  to  those  who have  been   intrumental     in  bringing to  pass  much  righteousness.  They  are instruments  in  God's  hand,  and  we should  not  ignore  that  they  are  such  instruments, and  we  should  honor  them a,s  such ;  but  when  we  undertake  to  give them  the  honor  for  accomplishing  this work  and  take  the  honor  from  God, who  qualified  the  men  to  do  the  work, we  are  doing  an  injustice  to  God. We  are  robbing  Him  of  the  honor  that rightfully  belongs  to  Him  and  giving  it to  men  who  are  only  instrumental  .in the  hands  of  God  in  accomplishing  His purposes. 

>>> In the fifth paragraph, Joseph F. Smith encourages the Latter-day Saints to go into their prayer rooms and there, either by themselves or with their families gathered around them, bow their knees before God Almighty in praise and thanksgiving. This practice of prayer and praise is not described as being quiet or silent. Instead, it involves active participation and expression of faith, which can include vocal prayers, hymns, and expressions of gratitude. This active participation in worship is a key aspect of Latter-day Saint practices. It’s important to note that while some aspects of worship may be quiet or reflective, this does not mean all practices are meant to be silent. The balance between quiet reflection and active participation can vary based on the specific practice or tradition.

I  thank  God  for  our  conference, for  the  good  words  that  have  been spoken,  and  for  the  honor  that  has been  shown  the  cause  of  truth  and the  presiding  authorities  of  the Church,  on  the  part  of  the  people who  have  attended ;  the  good  spirit that  has  pervaded  our  meetings,  the joy  that  we  have  felt  in  looking upon  your  faces,  and  the  pleasure that  I  trust  you  have  also  felt  in being  present  during  the  conference. God  bless  this  people  and  all the  good  of  the  earth,  and  overrule all  the  acts  of  men  to  praise  Him and  to  ultimately  bring  to  pass  glorious results  and  His  righteous  will, is  my  prayer,  in  the  name  of  Jesus. Amen. 

>>> This paragraph describes a conference, which is a type of worship practice in the Latter-day Saint tradition. Conferences are typically large gatherings where sermons are delivered, hymns are sung, and communal prayers are offered. These activities are not quiet but involve active participation from the attendees. The joy and pleasure mentioned in the paragraph also suggest a lively atmosphere. The phrase “the good spirit that has pervaded our meetings” could refer to the feeling of unity and shared faith among the participants, which is often expressed through communal worship practices that are not quiet. The act of praising God and praying for His blessings, as mentioned in the last sentence, can also be done in a vocal and communal manner during these conferences.
