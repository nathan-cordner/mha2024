Now for counsel more specific. Husbands and fathers: With your dear partner, shape attitudes at home. Establish a pattern of prayer. Pray regularly and vocally for your priesthood and auxiliary leaders, both local and general. Your manners of courtesy at home and of reverence in the chapel will be copied by members of your family. Help your loved ones follow proper channels when they seek guidance. Teach that counsel should be obtained from trusted parents and leaders on a local level, not from General Authorities. In the past two decades, the First Presidency has sent out essentially the same letter six times to reaffirm that policy. 

>>> The phrase “Pray regularly and vocally” suggests that prayer, a key aspect of Latter-day Saint worship, is not always a silent practice. Vocal prayer can be a communal activity that involves expressing faith and devotion out loud, which can foster a sense of community and shared faith among worshippers. It’s a way to verbally communicate with God, expressing gratitude, seeking guidance, or asking for blessings, and it’s a practice that can be both personal and communal in nature. This active, vocal participation contrasts with quiet, reflective worship practices.

Then I asked this elder to read from “Reverently and Meekly Now.” These words are particularly poignant because they are written as the Lord would express His own answer to the very question that had been asked: Think of me, thou ransomed one; Think what I for thee have done. With my blood that dripped like rain, Sweat in agony of pain, With my body on the tree I have ransomed even thee. … Oh, remember what was done That the sinner might be won. On the cross of Calvary I have suffered death for thee.

>>> This paragraph suggests that the practice of reading aloud from religious texts is a part of Latter-day Saint worship. The act of reading aloud is a vocal activity, which contrasts with silent worship practices. Reading aloud can help to engage the congregation, making the words more impactful and memorable. It can also foster a sense of community, as the words are shared audibly with everyone present. This practice is not meant to be quiet, as it involves vocalizing the words of the text, in this case, a poignant passage reflecting on the sacrifices made by the Lord. This vocal practice allows for the communal sharing and internalization of these deeply meaningful religious sentiments.

WORSHIP

First, “we believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost”  A of F 1:1 We worship our Heavenly Father and pray to Him in the name of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, through the power of the Holy Ghost. We revere the Son of God as our Savior, our Redeemer, and our Master. He came into the world to do the will of His Father (see  3 Ne. 27:13 He died for us and was resurrected from the tomb. His triumph over death brings the blessings of resurrection and immortality to all mankind (see  1 Cor. 15:20–22 Our adoration for Him is typified in this passage from the Book of Mormon: “We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, … that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins”  2 Ne. 25:26

>>> This paragraph suggests that the practice of talking, rejoicing, preaching, and prophesying about Christ is a part of Latter-day Saint worship. These activities are vocal and public expressions of faith, which contrasts with silent worship practices. They are meant to be shared with others, both within and outside the church community, to spread the teachings of Christ and the joy of His gospel. This practice is not meant to be quiet, as it involves vocalizing faith and sharing it with others. It allows for the communal sharing and internalization of these deeply meaningful religious sentiments.

President Hinckley said that “these unique and wonderful buildings, and the ordinances administered therein, represent the ultimate in our worship. These ordinances become the most profound expressions of our theology.” 

Ordinances of the temple relate to personal progress and to the redemption of departed ancestors as well. “For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, … they without us cannot be made perfect—neither can we without our dead be made perfect.” Service in their behalf provides repeated opportunities for temple worship. And that service deserves commitment to a planned schedule. By doing for others what they cannot do for themselves, we emulate the pattern of the Savior, who wrought the Atonement to bless the lives of other people. 

>>> (Previous two paragraphs):  These paragraphs suggest that the practice of performing ordinances and services in the temple are part of Latter-day Saint worship. These activities are not silent as they involve vocal prayers, singing hymns, and participating in religious ceremonies. They are meant to be shared with others within the temple and are a form of active worship. This practice is not meant to be quiet, as it involves vocalizing faith and sharing it with others. It allows for the communal sharing and internalization of these deeply meaningful religious sentiments.

My dear brothers and sisters, the assaults of the adversary are increasing exponentially, in intensity and in variety. Our need to be in the temple on a regular basis has never been greater. I plead with you to take a prayerful look at how you spend your time. Invest time in your future and in that of your family. If you have reasonable access to a temple, I urge you to find a way to make an appointment regularly with the Lord—to be in His holy house—then keep that appointment with exactness and joy. I promise you that the Lord will bring the miracles He knows you need as you make sacrifices to serve and worship in His temples. 

Building and maintaining temples may not change your life, but spending your time in the temple surely will. To those who have long been absent from the temple, I encourage you to prepare and return as soon as possible. Then I invite you to worship in the temple and pray to feel deeply the Savior’s infinite love for you, that each of you may gain your own testimony that He directs this sacred and ageless work.

This sacred shout was first given in this dispensation at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple on March 27, 1836. It is now given at the dedication of each temple. It is a sacred tribute to the Father and the Son, symbolizing the reaction of the multitude when the Savior made His triumphal entry into Jerusalem. It also reaffirms what young Joseph experienced that day in the Sacred Grove﻿﻿—namely, that the Father and the Son are two glorified Beings, whom we worship and praise. 

>>> This paragraph describes the practice of giving a “sacred shout” at the dedication of each temple. This is a vocal expression of worship and is therefore not a quiet practice. The shout is a tribute to the Father and the Son and symbolizes the reaction of the multitude when Jesus made His triumphal entry into Jerusalem.

We have gone to these extraordinary efforts because when we remove the Lord’s name from the name of His Church, we inadvertently remove Him as the central focus of our worship and our lives. When we take the Savior’s name upon us at baptism, we commit to witness, by our words, thoughts, and actions, that Jesus is the Christ. 

>>> This paragraph refers to the commitment made at baptism to witness that Jesus is the Christ through words, thoughts, and actions. This witnessing often involves vocal expressions of faith and is therefore not a quiet practice.

Nothing invites the Spirit more than fixing your focus on Jesus Christ. Talk of Christ, rejoice in Christ, feast upon the words of Christ, and press forward with steadfastness in Christ. Make your Sabbath a delight as you worship Him, partake of the sacrament, and keep His day holy. 

>>> This paragraph encourages talking of Christ and rejoicing in Christ, which are vocal expressions of worship and therefore not quiet practices. It also mentions partaking of the sacrament, which involves communal prayer and singing hymns, both of which are not quiet practices.

PRAISE

As a symbol of gratitude, I have penned a few lines to be sung as the concluding portion of my message. A verse for each of three scenes of history may summarize my remarks. This song will be new to you. The words have been written to music from Wales. For the gracious support of Brother Jerold D. Ottley and our male chorus I express my appreciation. To this song I have assigned an ancient title, “Hosanna,” the prayerful shout of fervent praise: 

>>> This paragraph describes a song that Russell M. Nelson has written to be sung as the concluding portion of his message. Singing is a form of worship that is vocal and therefore not quiet. The song is titled “Hosanna,” which is described as a “prayerful shout of fervent praise,” further emphasizing the vocal and loud nature of this worship practice.

A few examples include:  “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise”  Matt. 21:16 emphasis added).  “The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master”  Luke 6:40 In both of these verses, perfect came from the Greek term katartizo, which means “to fit out, equip, put in order, arrange, adjust; to fit or frame for one’s self”—an act of preparation.  Another speaks of “perfect understanding”  Luke 1:3 emphasis added). In this instance, perfect came from the Greek adverb akribos, which means “exactly, accurately.”  Another verse refers to those who touched the hem of the Master’s garment and “were made perfectly whole”  Matt. 14:36 emphasis added). Perfect in this instance came from the Greek diasozo, which means “to preserve through danger, to bring safely through, to save, keep from perishing, to rescue.”

>>> This paragraph includes a quote from Matthew 21:16, “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise.” The act of praise, especially when it is perfected, often involves vocal expressions of worship and is therefore not a quiet practice.

These prophecies of hope could materialize if leaders and citizens of nations would apply the teachings of Jesus Christ. Ours could then be an age of unparalleled peace and progress. Barbarism of the past would be buried. War with its horrors would be relegated to the realm of maudlin memory. Aims of nations would be mutually supportive. Peacemakers could lead in the art of arbitration, give relief to the needy, and bring hope to those who fear. Of such patriots, future generations would shout praises, and our Eternal God would pass judgments of glory. 

>>> This paragraph mentions that future generations would “shout praises” to patriots. This suggests a form of worship that is vocal and therefore not quiet.

Recently I observed such a mighty change in a man whom I first met about 10 years ago. He had come to a stake conference at which his son was sustained as a member of the new stake presidency. This father was not a member of the Church. After his son had been set apart, I put my arms around this father and praised him for having such a wonderful son. Then I boldly declared: “The day will come when you will want to have this son sealed to you and your wife in a holy temple. And when that day comes, I would be honored to perform that sealing for you.” 

>>> In this paragraph, Russell M. Nelson speaks to a father about a future event where his son would be sealed to him and his wife in a holy temple. The act of sealing, which is a sacred Latter-day Saint ritual, involves spoken words and is therefore not a quiet practice.

Dear brothers and sisters, I add my voice to that of President Thomas S. Monson and others in praising those who have responded to a prophet’s call for more worthy missionaries. Now an unprecedented wave of enthusiasm for missionary work is sweeping the entire earth. Since President Monson’s historic announcement last October, thousands of elders, sisters, and couples have been called, and many more are preparing. Now we get questions like “What are you going to do with all these missionaries?” The answer is simple. They will do what missionaries have always done. They will preach the gospel! They will bless the children of Almighty God! 

>>> This paragraph describes the act of preaching the gospel, which is a vocal form of worship and therefore not quiet.

For example, at the conclusion of the Sunday morning session, we will convene a worldwide solemn assembly when I will lead you in the sacred Hosanna Shout.
