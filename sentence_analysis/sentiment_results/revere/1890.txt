Laboring  and  struggling daily  and  hourly  to  meet  the  physical  needs  of  man,  or  to  gratify  some  desire  in  the  line  of  amusement,  our  minds  are  taken  away  from  that  regard  and  respect  to  the  Sabbath  day,  and  that  regard  and  reverence  and  respect to  the  requirements  of  our  Heavenly Father  in  connection  with  the  softening  of  our  minds  and  putting  our  spirits  in  touch  with  Him,  that  the  tendency  to  simply  go  to  Sabbath  school  or  to  attend  one  service  upon  the  Sabbath  day,  either  in  the  Tabernacle or  in  the  ward  meeting  houses, or  other  buildings,  and  then  to  hitch  up  our  teams  and  drive  about  the  city,  or  into  the  canyons,  or  to  be  found  following  up  the  streams  and  fishing,  and  indulging in  these  species  of  recreation,  to  my  mind  is  not  in  keeping  with  the  spirit  and  nature  of  the  work  the  Lord  has  set  us  to  do.

I  pray  that  the  Spirit  of  the  Lord  may  indeed  be  in  our  midst,  that  the  determination  shall  be  a  fixed  and  established one  that  in  the  homes  of  the  Latter-day  Saints,  wherever  they  may  be  situated, shall  be  found  a  people  who  revere  and  respect  the  sacred  day  which  God  has  designated  as  a  day  of  rest,  that  that  day  shall  not  become  a  day  of  pleasure  but,  upon  the  contrary, a  day  of  worship,  of  reverence,  and  love  for  the  Supreme  Being,  and  that  each  one  will  seek  to  do  his  Father's  bidding  in  this  respect,  and  keep  His  commandments.

Our  young  men  who  go  away  to    get  education  come  back  in  many  instances  with  their  faith  weakened,  because  they  do  not  revere  the  principles  of  the  Gospel  and  hold  fast  to  them  as  immutable  truths.

I  think  it  is  very  consistent  for  the  man  that  reverences God  and  acknowledges  His  hand:  in  all  things,  who  realizes  that  the  Lord  provides,  and  who  understands  this  in  his  experience,  to  say:  "Our  Father,  which  art  in  heaven  we  thank  Thee  for  this  food,  and  pray  Thee  to  bless  it  to  the  healing  and  nourishing  of  our  bodies,  and  let  Thy  Spirit  be  in  our  hearts,  and  guide  and  direct  us  as  Thy  children,  in  the  name  of  Jesus.

It  seems  to  me  that  the  proper  application  of  our  home  governing  to  awaken  in  their  minds  that  sacred reverence  or  love  for  the  Supreme  Being,  would  bridge  most  of  the  chasms  that  are  found  in  the  way  of  the  development  of  legitimate  and  proper  faith  in  the  minds  of  some  of  the  thoughtless  ones.
