It  has  certainly  done  my  heart  good  to  see  after   long   years    of   waiting,    due  appreciation   of   the    Mormon   pioneers,   and   though   most   of   them  have  passed  away  and  did  not  hear  these    words    of   praise,    but    were  under  constant  misrepresentation  by  the  world,  to see  them  come  to  their  own,  and  receive  the  credit  which  is  due  them,  I  say,  does  my  heart  good.

For  many  years,  and  perhaps  still,  with  some  people,  the  doctrine  existed that  man  was  made  by  our  Father  in  Heaven  for  the  purpose  of  giving  him  praise;  but  in  the  Pearl  of  Great  Price  we  have  the  true  doctrine  in  reference  to  that  matter,  as  revealed  from  the  Lord,  "Behold,  this  is  my  work  and  my  glory :  to  bring  to  pass  the  immortality and  eternal  life  of  man.

Not  the  matter  of  singing  praise  unto  Him,  as  the  chief  glory  of  God,  as  declared  by  some  formal  statements   of  creed ;  but  the  glory  of  God  is  in  bringing  to  pass  the  immortality  and  eternal  life  of  us,  His  creatures.

"And  also  this  church,  to  put  upon  it  thy  name;  and  help  us  by  the  power  of  thy  Spirit,  that  we  may  mingle  our  voices with  those  bright,  shining  seraphs  around  thy  throne,  with  acclamations  of  praise,  singing,  Hosanna  to  God  and  the  Lamb.
