My  Father  in  Heaven  is  a  witness  that  I  have  never  sought  or  desired  any  prominence  in  this  world,  but  have  rather  desired  to  lead  a  quiet  life,  thinking  myself  not  worthy  to  be  anything  but  the  least  in  the  kingdom  of  God.

One  thing  that  added  to  its  charm  was,  it  was  a  land  of  liberty,  a  land  of  freedom,  a  land  where  mobs  could  not  come  and  attack  us,  as  they  had  done  in  the  past;  a  place  where  the  families  of  the  Saints,  and  the  leading men  among  them,  could  go  to  bed  in  peace  and  quietness,  undisturbed  by  the  fear  that  they  would  be  attacked  during  the  night.

We  would  be  less  than  human  if  we  could  sit  quietly by  and  see  people  massacred  and  starved  to  death  as  they  have  been  and  are  being  on  the  island  of  Cuba.

There  is  one  course  that  has  been  taken  which  I  think  will  be  attended  with  good  effects,  that    is,  counseling  the  Saints  in  the  various  lands  where  they  embrace  the  Gospel  to  remain  quiet  for  awhile;  to  not  be  anxious  to  break  up  their  homes  to  gather  to  Zion.

Some  very  good  things  have  been  said  in  testimony  and  otherwise  which  have  been  lost  to  a  portion  of  the  congregation;  but  I  believe  if  we  were  quiet  throughout  this  building  that  it  would  not  be  very  difficult  to  hear  an  ordinary  voice  in  every  part  of  it.
