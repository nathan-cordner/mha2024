Do  you  think  a  man  who  comes  into  the  sacrament  service  in  the  spirit  of  prayer,  humility,  and  worship,  and  who  partakes  of  these  emblems  representing  the  body  and  blood  of  Jesus  Christ,  will  knowingly  break  the  commandments  of  the  Lord?

If  a  man  fully  realizes  what  it  means  when  he  partakes  of  the  sacrament,  that  he  covenants  to  take  upon  him  the  name  of  Jesus  Christ  and  to  always  remember  him  and  keep  his  commandments,  and  this  vow  is  renewed  week  by  week — do  you  think  such  a  man  will  fail  to  pay  his  tithing?

Well,  we  figure  out  how  little  we  can  pay,  and  our  hearts  "pucker"  up,  and  we  don't  keep  the  covenant,  the  pledge  we  make  every  Sabbath  day  at  the  sacrament  table.

When  we  partake  of  the  sacrament  let  our  hearts  and  hands  be  clean  and  pure,  and  let  our  testimonies  and  our  obedience  be  as  firm  and  implicit  as  our  declarations;  for  I  hold  that  a  man's  testimony  of  the  gospel  is  no  stronger  than  his  obedience  unto  its  principles.
