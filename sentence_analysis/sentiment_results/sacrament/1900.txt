I  admonish  you,  my  brethren,  that  when  we  officiate  in  administering  the  sacrament,  we  repeat,  if  possible,  the  exact  words  given  by  revelation,  and  that  we  do  so  with  the  Spirit  of  the  Lord.

Then  I  say  also  to  those  who  partake of  the  sacrament,  we  should  consider  seriously  the  covenants  we  make  with  our  Father.

Let  none  of  us  be  under  condemnation by  partaking  of  the  sacrament  unworthily,  thereby  being deprived  of  the  companionship  of  the  Spirit  of  our  Father.

If  we  can  partake  of  the  sacrament  worthily,  we  can  love  each  other,  even  as  our  Father  has  ordained ;  remembering  that  He  has  said  unto  us:  "If_ye  are  not  one,  ye  are  not  mine.

Behold,  verily,  thus  saith  the  Lord  unto  you,  in  consequence  of  evils  and  designs  which  do  and  will  exist  in  the  hearts  of  conspiring  men  in  the  last  days,  I  have  warned  you,  and  forewarn  you,  by  giving  unto  you  this  word  of  wisdom  by  revelation,   That  inasmuch  as  any  man  drinketh  wine  or  strong  drink  among  you,  behold  it  is  not  good,  neither  meet  in  the  sight  of  your  Father,  only  in  assembling  yourselves together  to  offer  up  your  sacraments before  him.

Efforts  have  been  made  in  numbers  of  cases  to  bring  this  matter before  the  presiding  brethren  and  sisters  in  the  various  stakes  of  Zion,  to  try  to  bring  them  not  only  to  observe  the  Word  of  Wisdom  and  the  law  of  tithing,  not  only  to  meet  together  and  partake  of  the  Sacrament,  but  to  make  the  legitimate and  proper  use  of  the  Sabbath  day.

We  do  not  believe  in  the  long-faced  kind  of  religion,  but  we  do  believe  that  the  Sunday  should  be  used  as  the  Lord  has  commanded, namely,  to  go  to  His  house  to  be  built  up  and  strengthened  in  our  holy  faith,  to  go  to  His  table,  renew  our  covenants  in  partaking  of  the  sacrament,  and  make  our  resolves  to  serve  God  so  firm  and  so  strong  that  they  will  carry  us  through  not  only  the  Sunday  but  every  day  of  the  week.

I  care  not  for  the  cranks  that  may  arise  from  time  to  time,  for  their  lives  are  short;  but  it  seems  to  me  that  when  a  man  like  Dr.  Charles  R.  Eliot,  of  the  great  Harvard  University,  comes  out  and  announces  as  a  new  doctrine a  faith  that  denies  the  Divinity of  Jesus  Christ,  that  denies  that  man  is  made  in  God's  image,  that  denies  the  authenticity  of  all  biblical miracles,  the  efficacy  of  prayer, the  supernatural  value  of  the  sacrament,  the  merit  of  self-sacrifice, and  even  denies  the  immortality of  the  soul — it  strikes  me,  my  brethren  and  sisters,  that  there  is  danger  for  Christianity  among  the  people.

Now,  my  brethren  and  sisters,  I  come  to  that  portion  of  this  revelation, to  which  I  desire,  more  particularly, to  call  your  attention :   "And  that  thou  mayest  more  fully  keep  thyself  unspotted  from  this  world,  thou  shalt  go to  the  house  of  prayer  and  offer  up  thy  sacraments  upon  my  holy  day;   "For  verily  this  is  a  day  appointed  unto  you  to  rest  from  your  labors,  and  to  pay  thy  devotions  unto  the  Most  High;   "Nevertheless  thy  vows  shall  be  offered up  in  righteousness  on  all  days  and  at  all  times;   "But  remember  that  on  this  the  Lord's  day,  thou  shalt  offer  thine  oblations and  thy  sacraments  unto  the  Most  High,  confessing  thy  sins  unto thy  brethren,  and  before  the  Lord.

My  brethren  and  sisters, if  there  is  one  thing  more  than  another  that  these  presidents  need  to  take  back  into  the  different  stakes,  over  which  they  preside ;  that  these  Bishops  need  to  teach  in  the  wards  over  which  they  preside;  that  you  Elders of  Israel  need  to  teach  by  precept and  example  in  the  communities of  Latter-day  Saints,  it  is  a  righteous  observance  of  the  Sabbath day — a  day  hallowed  and  made  sacred  and  holy  by  the  Lord,  for  His  worship,  not  a  day  of  pleasure, not  a  day  for  excursions  into  the  canyons,  not  a  day  for  automobile rides  into  the  country,  not  a  day  for  baseball  games  on  the  public square,  not  a  day  for  horseraces in  the  park,  not  a  day  when  the  Lord  is  forgotten  and  the  pleasures of  the  world  sought ;  but  a  day  when  God  requires  His  people  to  gather  together  and  partake  of  the  sacrament,  acknowledging  their  allegiance to  Him  and  His  Son,  and  entering  into  covenants  with  Him  that  they  will  keep  His  commandments.

It  is  observed that  men  and  women  who  go  from  year  to  year  without  partaking    of  the  Lord's  Supper,  gradually  lose  the  Spirit  of  our  Heavenly  Father ;  they  forfeit  its  companionship where  they  have  had  opportunity to  participate  in  that  blessing,  but  have  failed  to  take  advantage  of  it.

This  language  I  know  can  be  interpreted  in  two  ways,  but  we  may  understand  the  meaning  when  we  think  of  Peter's  expression  at  the  last  supper,  when  Jesus  said    that  there  would  be  many  that  would  be  offended  at  Him.
