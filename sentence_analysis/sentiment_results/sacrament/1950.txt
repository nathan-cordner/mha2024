Again, it was necessary for the Lord to make it clear to the people that the Sabbath day is his day, a holy day, for on August 7, 1831, one hundred and twenty-seven years ago, an American Prophet, Joseph Smith, received a revelation from the Lord, "And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day; "For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High" We of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints accept this marvelous revelation, and we accept and look upon the Sabbath day of the Lord as the most sacred day of the week.
