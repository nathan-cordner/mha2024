Later,  while  the  Prophet  was  in  quest  of  wine  to  administer  the  sacrament,  he  was  told  by  the  Lord :   For,  behold,  I  say  unto  you,  that  it  mattereth  not  what  ye  shall  eat  or  what  ye  shall  drink  when  ye  partake  of  the  sacrament,  if  it  so  be  that  ye  do  it  with  an  eye  single  to  my  glory — remembering  unto  the  Father  my  body  which  was  laid  down  for  you,  and  my  blood  which  was  shed  for  the  remission  of  your  sins.
