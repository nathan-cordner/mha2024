He  thought  there  was  freedom  enough  in  Finland  for  men  and  women  to  worship  God  according  to  the  dictates  of  their  conscience,  but  he  did  not  know  how  much  the  Elders  had  been  persecuted there.

The  work  is  progressing,  and  I  hope  the  time  will  soon  come  when  those  countries  where  there  is  no  freedom  to  worship  God,  as  men  feel  to  do,  may  be  given  such  liberty.

As  a  result  of  this  belief  and  of  this  preaching,  the  Christian  churches  have  been  almost  depleted  of  their  membership ;  there  lies  at  least  been  a  great  falling  off  in  attendance  at  Divine  worship ;  and  I  think  that  Doctor  Eliot's  crystallization of  these  beliefs  into  a  sort  of  creed,  will  accomplish,  perhaps,  the  entire  depletion  of  the  churches  of  the  various  Christian  denominations.

Thus  He  is  our  advocate  with  the  Father ;  through  Him  the  blessings  of  the  Father  come  to  us ;  and  if  we  please  the  Lord  we  not  only  love  Him  with  all  our  hearts,  we  not  only  keep  His  commandments,  we  not  only  worship  Him,  but  we  recognize His  Son  as  our  advocate  with  the  Father,  and  through  Him  we  approach  the  throne  of  grace.

My  brethren  and  sisters,  if  there  is  one  thing  more  than  another  that  these  presidents  need  to  take  back  into  the  different  stakes,  over  which  they  preside ;  that  these  Bishops  need  to  teach  in  the  wards  over  which  they  preside;  that  you  Elders of  Israel  need  to  teach  by  precept and  example  in  the  communities of  Latter-day  Saints,  it  is  a  righteous  observance  of  the  Sabbath day — a  day  hallowed  and  made  sacred  and  holy  by  the  Lord,  for  His  worship,  not  a  day  of  pleasure, not  a  day  for  excursions  into  the  canyons,  not  a  day  for  automobile rides  into  the  country,  not  a  day  for  baseball  games  on  the  public square,  not  a  day  for  horseraces in  the  park,  not  a  day  when  the  Lord  is  forgotten  and  the  pleasures of  the  world  sought ;  but  a  day  when  God  requires  His  people  to  gather  together  and  partake  of  the  sacrament,  acknowledging  their  allegiance to  Him  and  His  Son,  and  entering  into  covenants  with  Him  that  they  will  keep  His  commandments.

"And  after  he  had  said  these  words,  he  said  unto  me,  Look!  and  I  looked,  and  I  beheld  the  Son  of  God  going  forth  among  the  children  of  men;  and  I  saw  many  fall  down  at  his  feet  and  worship  him.

In  this  the  dispensation  of  the  fulness  of  times,  as  it  was  predicted, an  angel  came  flying  through  the  midst  of  heaven,  having  the  everlasting  Gospel  to  preach  unto  them  that  dwell  upon  the  face  of  the  earth,  to  every  nation,  kindred,  tongue  and  people;  and  this  was  his  cry :  "Fear  God  and  give  glory  to  Him,  for  the  hour  of  His  judgment is  come ;  and  worship  Him  that  made  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  and  the  seas,  and  the  fountains of  water.

It  is  pleasing,  and  I  think,  indeed,  fitting  that  this  house  of  worship  should  be  decorated  with  the  Stars  and  Stripes,  the  colors  and  emblem  of  our  country;  for  I  know  of  no  religion,  except  ours,  that  has  as  one  of  its  religious  beliefs  or  doctrines, the  fact  that  the  Constitution of  the  United  States  was  divinely inspired.

All  that  was  not  that  any  particular  brand  of  church  might  be  established; that  is  to  say,  that  they  wanted  this  church  or  the  other  church;  the  fight  was — let  me  tell  you  again — that  liberty  should  be  established,  so  that  men  could  worship as  they  pleased,  how  they  pleased,  or  not  worship  at  all,  if  they  so  pleased.
