But  I  notice  that  while  this  spirit  of  amusement  is  legitimate  and  proper  in  the  sphere  of  our  every-day  life,  the  tendency  seems  to  be  growing  among  many  to  disregard  the  Sabbath  day  and  to  change  it  from  the  day  of  worship, the  day  of  rest,  the  day  upon  which  we  may  be  enabled  to  commune  with  our  own  thoughts  and  to  reach  out  after  the  inspiration  of  the  Spirit  of  God— that  tendency,  I  say,  is  a  growing  one,  to  change  that  day  into  a  day  of  pleasure;  and  to  my  mind,  as  I  look  around  and  note  that  tendency,  I  am  sanguine  that  it  is  not  for  the  best,  but,  upon  the  contrary,  that,  unless proper  means  shall  be  adopted  to  change  this  tendency,  the  sacred  character of  that  day  and  the  obligation  that  rests  upon  us  as  the  children  of  our  Heavenly  Father  to  worship  Him,  is  going  to  result  badly;  and  it  looks  to  me  that  an  earnest  effort  should  be  made  by  the  Elders  of  the  Church  to  more  deeply  impress  upon  the  minds  of  those  of  middle  age  and  upon  the  younger  and  growing  generations,  the   sacredness  of  that  day.

Well,  I  say  this,  my  brethren  and  sisters, in  regard  to  this  question  of  riding of  horses  and  bicycles,  the  driving of  teams,  and  such  like  upon  the  Sabbath  day:  I  recognize  that  many  are  so  situated,  being  miles  away  from  places  of  worship,  that  they  must  of  necessity  drive  their  teams  in  order  to  take  their  families  to  their  legitimate  and  proper  places  of  worship,— I  have  nothing  to  say  with  reference  to  this  matter,  but  when  Our  teams  are  hitched  up  every  Sabbath  afternoon  and  driven  for  hours  and  hours  for  pleasure,  I  think  we  trench  upon  ground  upon  which  we  should  not  enter.
