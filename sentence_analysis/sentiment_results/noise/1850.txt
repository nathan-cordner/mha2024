I will say, in regard to the sisters who bring children here to make a noise, they have never yet sufficiently thought, nor sufficiently considered their own place in this world, nor the place of others, to know that there is any other person living on the earth  but themselves; and they think, when they hear people talk, that it is a noise through a dark veil.
