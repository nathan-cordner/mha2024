And the statement of the Christ 2,000 years ago wherein he declared, "And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: "Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath" And the revelation to the Prophet Joseph, "And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day; "For verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High" In conclusion, my brethren and sisters, I bear testimony to you if we will follow and live the words of the Prophet Moses, of Jesus Christ the Son of God and the Prophet Joseph Smith, a divine prophet, in keeping the Sabbath day holy, the Lord, in turn, will bless us guide us, direct us, and inspire us which I pray will be the blessing of all of us, in the name of Jesus Christ.
