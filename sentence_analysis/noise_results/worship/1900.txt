I  wonder  if  at  any  previous  time  in  the  history  of  God's  dealings  with  the  children  of  men  there  was  ever  such  a  sight  as  we  behold here  today — this  large  Tabernacle  filled  to  overflowing,  every  seat  occupied, and  people  standing  in  the  aisles  and  along  the  walls;  and  just  over  the  way,  in  the  Assembly  Hall,  another  gathering  of  Latter-day  Saints,  unable  to  gain  admittance  to  this  building,  are  worshipping  the  Lord,  and  celebrating  this  day  of  prosperity,  joy  and  happiness for  the  people  of  the  kingdom  of  God;  for  notwithstanding  our  individual deprivations  and  afflictions,  and  the  absence  from  us  of  one  of  our  beloved  leaders  (President  George  Q.  Cannon),  there  never  was  a  time  in  the  history  of  this  Church  when  the  people  were  more  blessed  of  the  Lord,  temporally  and  spiritually,  than  they  are  today.
