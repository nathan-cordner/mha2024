Some  men  disregard  this  commandment  to  the  extent  that  they  go  to  their  fields  and  work  upon  the  Sabbath  day;  some  attend  horse  races,  or  theatres,  or  pleasure resorts,  etc.,  on  the  Sabbath  day.  Others  have  advanced  so  far  towards  perfection  in  righteousness  that  they  cannot  look  upon  such  conduct  with  toleration ;  it  is  sin  and  wickedness  in  their  sight,  and  yet  some  of  them,  perhaps,  will  justify themselves  in  going  out  for  a  carriage  ride,  or  an  automobile  ride,    or  perhaps  remain  at  home  on  the  Sabbath  day,  although  the  commandment is  that  we  shall  meet  together, partake  of  the  sacrament  and  worship  the  Lord  our  God.

Opposed  to  this  idea  is  the  doctrine of  Christianity,  which  teaches  self  sacrifice,  that  the  strong  should    not  only  respect  but  help  the  weak,  that  he,  too,  may  become  strong,  that  in  both  civil  and  religious  life  man  should  follow  his  own  inclination, framing  such  laws  as  seem  best  adapted to  his  condition,  and  administering  them  in  his  own  way,  worshiping  whom  or  what  he  may  desire,  or  not  worshiping  at  all,  but  with  this  one  fundamental  truth  written  in  his  creed,  that  whether  great  or  small,  he  has  no  authority,  either  in  civil  or  religious  life,  to  infringe  upon  the  rights  of  his  neighbor,  or  exercise  coercion  or  unrighteous  dominion  over  him.
