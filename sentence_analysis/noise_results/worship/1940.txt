History affirms that when any group of people have had as their belief the concept that God was a God of love, charity, and kindness; in other words, when they have accepted God as a divine Being possessing all of the characteristics of goodness in an infinite portion, those people have tried to emulate in their lives that type of Deity On the other hand, when a group of people have believed that the Eternal Father was a God of caprice, a God who is unjust and prone to play favoritism, we find that those people have resorted to very low forms and modes of worship, such as human sacrifice.

The later prophets in Israel—Elijah vindicated by a miracle, that he was a prophet of God; yet Jezebel hunted him like a wild beast and would have killed him had not the Lord taken him by a miracle; and Isaiah and Jeremiah, these prophets spoke not only about righteous living and what Israel should do in their family life and in their religious worship, but those prophets spoke also of the relationship of nations and how Israel should bear herself toward those nations, but their warnings and prophecies went unheeded, and the calamities which they predicted came.

"  Thus was sacrificed the true office of divine worship and guidance, instead of holding up before men the ideal of the God-given and perfect gospel law and fortifying them for the struggle incident to the conquest of evil, they were seduced into deadening compromises with sin, and progress toward the ultimate triumph of righteousness was immeasurably retarded.
